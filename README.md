# bibtex-to-markdown

A Python-based utility for converting BibTeX entries into Markdown notes compatible with Obsidian, Pandoc, and reference-based workflows.

---

## 📌 Intent

This tool automates the process of transforming academic references from a BibTeX `.bib` file into individual Markdown notes. Each note is formatted for compatibility with:
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) citation processing (`[@citation_key]`)
- Obsidian-style `[[wikilinks]]` for internal navigation
- Markdown-based academic writing workflows

---

## ⚙️ Actions

The script performs the following actions:

- Parses a BibTeX file using `bibtexparser`
- Cleans and formats metadata including author names, titles, and keywords
- Creates one Markdown file per BibTeX entry
- Adds both a Pandoc-style filename (e.g., `@Smith2020-ab.md`) and Obsidian-style link in the frontmatter (`[[Smith2020-ab]]`)
- Inserts a Chicago-style bibliography block and optional abstract into each file
- Adds YAML `aliases` for citations (Full Title Case and optional Short Title Case)
- Generates author pages with YAML `aliases` (surname) and a Map of Content (MOC) using `[[@key|Short Title]]`

---

## 📥 Input

- A valid `.bib` file (BibTeX format), such as `main.bib`
- BibTeX keys must be unique
- Optional fields supported: `author`, `title`, `journal`, `publisher`, `url`, `year`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `institution`

---

## 📤 Output

- A folder called `markdown_entries/` (if not present, it is created)
- Inside this folder:
  - Individual Markdown files named using the format: `@BibTeXKey.md`
  - Each file includes:
    - YAML frontmatter with:
      - Title, year
      - Authors (with Obsidian-style links `[[Author Name]]`)
      - Key (in format `[[@BibTeXKey]]`)
      - Aliases (full title and optional short title)
      - Optional fields: institution, journal, publisher (all as Obsidian links)
      - Tags (from keywords)
    - Optional abstract
    - Chicago-style bibliography section
    - Pandoc-compatible filename for citation use (`[@BibTeXKey]`)

- A folder called `authors/`:
  - Individual Markdown files per author with:
    - YAML frontmatter including:
      - `author`: `"[[First Last]]"`
      - `aliases`: surname (for quick `[[Surname]]` links)
      - optional: `institution`, `field`, `type`
    - Heading with author name
    - `### Content:` section with MOC links of the form `[[@CitationKey|Short Title]]`
    - `#### Bibliography:` with embedded transclusions `![[@CitationKey]]`

> [!bibliography]
> Doyle, Arthur Conan. 1892. “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.” "[[George Newnes Ltd]]"

> [!abstract]
> The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, first published on 14 October 1892. It contains the earliest short stories featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, which had been published in twelve monthly issues of The Strand Magazine from July 1891 to June 1892. The stories are collected in the same sequence, which is not supported by any fictional chronology. The only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson, and all are related in first-person narrative from Watson's point of view.
```

Author file (`authors/Arthur Conan Doyle.md`):
```markdown

  - Doyle

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### 🟥 Problem: Filenames or links are not resolving in Obsidian  
✅ Check that the Markdown files are stored within your Obsidian vault  
✅ Ensure filenames use the `@BibTeXKey` format if linking via Pandoc citation syntax  
✅ Use `[[@BibTeXKey]]` or `[@BibTeXKey]` depending on purpose

### 🟥 Problem: Non-Latin characters or accents appear incorrectly  
✅ Text cleaning is applied, but additional edge cases can be adjusted in `clean_text()` or `format_authors()`

### 🟥 Problem: Markdown files overwrite each other  
✅ BibTeX keys must be unique; conflicts will silently overwrite existing files
