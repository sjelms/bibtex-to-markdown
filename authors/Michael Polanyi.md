### Known for
**[[Polanyi's paradox]]**, named in honour of the British-Hungarian philosopher [Michael Polanyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi "Michael Polanyi"), is the theory that human knowledge of how the world functions and of our own capability are, to a large extent, beyond our explicit understanding. The theory was articulated by Michael Polanyi in his book _The Tacit Dimension_ in 1966, and economist [[David H Autor]] gave it a name in his 2014 research paper "Polanyi's Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth".
