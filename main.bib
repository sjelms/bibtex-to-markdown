  publisher = "Routledge",
  abstract  = "Architects have been intrigued by prefabricated construction
               since the early twentieth century. Recent advances in design,
               engineering and manufacturing processes have led to a significant
               expansion in the use of pre-assembled components, which are
               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as ``offsite construction.'' A
               ground-breaking text, Offsite Architecture establishes the
               current – and future – state of thinking in this field. A range
               of the most highly regarded thinkers and practitioners from
               around the globe share their ideas and practical findings on
               offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,
               opportunities and challenges, successes and failures. A timely
               response to the growing interest in this method, the book
               provides the fundamental basis for a critical, reflective
               approach to offsite architecture. Contributions from both
               academics and professionals make Offsite Architecture required
               reading for practitioners as well as students taking courses in
               architecture, prefabrication, construction and engineering.",

  publisher = "Routledge",
  abstract  = "Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces âe`` ranging from offices, factories and shops to
               gyms, health centres and universities âe'' and how it can be
               improved. Such learning includes everyday work activity,
               on-the-job instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving
               Working as Learning is the first book to analyze systematically
               learning at work in different settings by developing and applying
               a new analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework
               connects the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are
               organized and the wider pressures and constraints organizations
               face for survival, growth and development. The authors
               convincingly demonstrate that the framework offers a
               sophisticated understanding of how improving the work environment
               âe`` both within the workplace and beyond âe'' can enhance and
               sustain improvements in learning at work. Each chapter presents
               evidence âe`` taken from both private and public sectors âe'' to
               illustrate how the Working as Learning Framework provides a means
               by which employers, researchers and policy-makers can Improve the
               conditions for nurturing and sustaining learning at workBuild
               appropriate workforce development plans within given
               constraintsRecognize that the creation and use of knowledge is
               widely distributedMobilize existing workplace resources to
               support learningEnhance and extend our understanding of how
               workplace learning is shaped by relationships at, and beyond, the
               workplace This topical book will appeal to an international
               readership of undergraduate and postgraduate students, vocational
