  abstract  = "Architects have been intrigued by prefabricated construction
               since the early twentieth century. Recent advances in design,
               engineering and manufacturing processes have led to a significant
               expansion in the use of pre-assembled components, which are
               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as ``offsite construction.'' A
               ground-breaking text, Offsite Architecture establishes the
               current – and future – state of thinking in this field. A range
               of the most highly regarded thinkers and practitioners from
               around the globe share their ideas and practical findings on
               offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,
               opportunities and challenges, successes and failures. A timely
               response to the growing interest in this method, the book
               provides the fundamental basis for a critical, reflective
               approach to offsite architecture. Contributions from both
               academics and professionals make Offsite Architecture required
               reading for practitioners as well as students taking courses in
               architecture, prefabrication, construction and engineering.",

               dimensions: (1) opportunities for engaging in multiple (and

  abstract  = "How the history of technological revolutions can help us better
               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.",

              and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use
              it to interpret changes in US employment over the recent past. At
              the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital
              and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which
              enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously
              engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor
              because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always
              reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand
              even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are
              counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a
              comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the
              task content of production in favor of labor because of a
              reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor
              demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of
              production—due to automation and new tasks—can be inferred from
              industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the
              slower growth of employment over the last three decades is
              accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect,
              especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and
              slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.",

  publisher = "Routledge",
  abstract  = "Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces – ranging from offices, factories and shops to gyms,
               health centres and universities – and how it can be improved.
               Such learning includes everyday work activity, on-the-job
               instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving Working as
               Learning is the first book to analyze systematically learning at
               work in different settings by developing and applying a new
               analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework connects
               the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are organized
               and the wider pressures and constraints organizations face for
               survival, growth and development. The authors convincingly
               demonstrate that the framework offers a sophisticated
               understanding of how improving the work environment – both within
               the workplace and beyond – can enhance and sustain improvements
               in learning at work. This topical book will appeal to an
               international readership of undergraduate and postgraduate
               students, vocational teachers and trainers, human resource

               offers an in-depth guide to the theories, practices, and policies
               of vocational education and training (VET). With contributions
               from a panel of leading international scholars, the Handbook
               contains 27 authoritative essays from a wide range of
               disciplines. The contributors present an integrated analysis of
               the complex and dynamic field of VET. Drawing on the most recent
               research, thinking, and practice in the field, the book explores
               the key debates about the role of VET in the education and
               training systems of various nations. The Handbook reveals how
               expertise is developed in an age of considerable transformation
               in work processes, work organization, and occupational
               identities. The authors also examine many of the challenges of
               vocational education and training such as the impact of digital
               technologies on employment, the demand for (re)training in the
               context of extended working lives, the emergence of learning
               regions and skill ecosystems, and the professional development of
               vocational teachers and trainers. This important text: Offers an
               original view of VET’s role in both the initial and continuing
               development of expertise Examines the theories and concepts that
               underpin international perspectives and explores the differences
               about the purposes of VET Presents various models of learning
               used in VET, including apprenticeship, and their relationship
               with general education Explores how VET is shaped in different
               ways by the political economy of different countries Reviews how
