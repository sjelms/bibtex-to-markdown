  abstract  = "Architects have been intrigued by prefabricated construction
               since the early twentieth century. Recent advances in design,
               engineering and manufacturing processes have led to a significant
               expansion in the use of pre-assembled components, which are
               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as ``offsite construction.'' A
               ground-breaking text, Offsite Architecture establishes the
               current – and future – state of thinking in this field. A range
               of the most highly regarded thinkers and practitioners from
               around the globe share their ideas and practical findings on
               offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,
               opportunities and challenges, successes and failures. A timely
               response to the growing interest in this method, the book
               provides the fundamental basis for a critical, reflective
               approach to offsite architecture. Contributions from both
               academics and professionals make Offsite Architecture required
               reading for practitioners as well as students taking courses in
               architecture, prefabrication, construction and engineering.",

  abstract  = "How the history of technological revolutions can help us better
               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.",

               as its key purposes, objects, formation and practices. In short,
               it seeks to outline and elaborate the nature of the project of
               vocational education. It addresses a significant gap in the
               available literature by providing a single text that elaborates
               the scope and diversity of the sector, its key objectives (i.e.
               vocations and occupations), its formation and development as an
               education sector, and the scope of its purposes and
               considerations in the curriculum. The volume achieves these
               objectives by discussing and defining the concept of vocational
               education as being that form of education that seeks to advise
               individuals about, prepare them for, and further develop their
               capacities to perform the kinds of occupations that societies
               require and individuals need to participate in—and through which
               they often come to define themselves. In particular, it discusses
               the distinctions between occupations as a largely social fact and
               vocations as being a socially shaped outcome assented to by
               individuals. As people identify closely with the kinds of
               occupations they engage in, the standing of, and the
               effectiveness of vocational education is central to individuals’
               well-being, competence and progress. Ultimately, this book argues
               that the provision of vocational education needs to realise
               important personal and social goals.",

  abstract  = "Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces – ranging from offices, factories and shops to gyms,
               health centres and universities – and how it can be improved.
               Such learning includes everyday work activity, on-the-job
               instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving Working as
               Learning is the first book to analyze systematically learning at
               work in different settings by developing and applying a new
               analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework connects
               the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are organized
               and the wider pressures and constraints organizations face for
               survival, growth and development. The authors convincingly

               the workplace and beyond – can enhance and sustain improvements

               American highways and IBM’s Watson trounced the best human
               Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies—with hardware, software,
               and networks at their core—will in the near future diagnose
               diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data
               sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once
               considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik
               Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee—two thinkers at the forefront of
               their field—reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our
               lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies
               is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling
               personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless
               access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this
               bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all
               kinds—from lawyers to truck drivers—will be forever upended.
               Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic
               indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and
               wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing
               on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson
               and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a
               new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that
               it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one,
               designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power
               with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a
               radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book,

               the protection and promotion of their common interests. The
               standard view of unions is that they are monopoly organizations
               that improve the welfare of members, principally by raising wages
               above the competitive level. For a union to be able to increase
               wage rates above the competitive level, there must be some
               surplus that can be shared between the firm and the union, and
               the union must have some bargaining power to induce the firm to
               share this surplus. This article investigates the conditions
               under which a union can increase wages, and explores ways of
               modeling the competing preferences of unions and management. The
               article also notes the arguments suggesting that, in the presence
               of imperfect information and uncertainty, unions may enhance
               efficiency. To the extent that unions reduce labor turnover and
               negotiating costs, they may increase the available surplus to be

  abstract  = "During the fall of 2014, the National Institute of Building
               Sciences Off-Site Construction Council conducted a survey in
               partnership member schools of the Association of Collegiate
               Schools of Architecture and the Associated Schools of
               Construction. The online survey was intended to determine the
               current state of teaching and research on the emerging practice
               of offsite prefabrication in the design and construction sector.
               The chapter focuses on the findings of the survey to illuminate
               the difference between what is being practiced within the
               construction sector and what is being learned and researched at
               higher-education institutions. Bridging the gap between education
               and industry is important in order to create knowledge pathways
               between what is being researched and taught and what is being
               practiced. Currently, research agendas on both sides of education
               and industry are mismatched, with schools focusing on product
               R\&D and industry needing continuing professional development and
               training as well as supply chain management support.",

               hostility and litigation between contractors are commonplace.
               Such a climate actively militates against collective learning and
               knowledge sharing between parties. Conversely, under
               ?collaborative working?, contractors share risks, pool knowledge
               and work together to solve problems at all stages and levels in
               the productive system ? a process conceptualised as ?knotworking?
               by some theorists. The paper argues that such learning theories
               fail to take adequately into account the heavy hand of history
               and the importance of understanding the nature of the productive
               systems in which ?knotworking? is expected to take root. Both

               vocational education and training written by international
               experts The Wiley Handbook of Vocational Education and Training
               offers an in-depth guide to the theories, practices, and policies
               of vocational education and training (VET). With contributions
               from a panel of leading international scholars, the Handbook
               contains 27 authoritative essays from a wide range of
               disciplines. The contributors present an integrated analysis of
               the complex and dynamic field of VET. Drawing on the most recent
               research, thinking, and practice in the field, the book explores
               the key debates about the role of VET in the education and
               training systems of various nations. The Handbook reveals how
               expertise is developed in an age of considerable transformation
               in work processes, work organization, and occupational
               identities. The authors also examine many of the challenges of
               vocational education and training such as the impact of digital
               technologies on employment, the demand for (re)training in the
               context of extended working lives, the emergence of learning
               regions and skill ecosystems, and the professional development of
               vocational teachers and trainers. This important text: Offers an
               original view of VET’s role in both the initial and continuing
               development of expertise Examines the theories and concepts that
               underpin international perspectives and explores the differences
               about the purposes of VET Presents various models of learning
               used in VET, including apprenticeship, and their relationship
               with general education Explores how VET is shaped in different
               ways by the political economy of different countries Reviews how
               developments in digital technologies are changing VET practice
               Discusses the challenges for universities offering higher

              and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use
              it to interpret changes in US employment over the recent past. At
              the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital
              and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which
              enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously
              engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor
              because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always
              reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand
              even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are
              counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a
              comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the
              task content of production in favor of labor because of a
              reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor
              demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of
              production—due to automation and new tasks—can be inferred from
              industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the
              slower growth of employment over the last three decades is
              accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect,
              especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and
              slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.",
