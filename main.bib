  abstract  = "Architects have been intrigued by prefabricated construction
               since the early twentieth century. Recent advances in design,
               engineering and manufacturing processes have led to a significant
               expansion in the use of pre-assembled components, which are
               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as ``offsite construction.'' A
               ground-breaking text, Offsite Architecture establishes the
               current – and future – state of thinking in this field. A range
               of the most highly regarded thinkers and practitioners from
               around the globe share their ideas and practical findings on
               offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,
               opportunities and challenges, successes and failures. A timely
               response to the growing interest in this method, the book
               provides the fundamental basis for a critical, reflective
               approach to offsite architecture. Contributions from both
               academics and professionals make Offsite Architecture required
               reading for practitioners as well as students taking courses in
               architecture, prefabrication, construction and engineering.",
