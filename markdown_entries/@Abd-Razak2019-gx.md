## Abstract
The causes of operational failure remain unclear to those tasked with both delivering projects and managing operational assets. Greater awareness of the owner and their supply network capabilities to mitigate failure could reduce significant quality costs that can amount to many millions of pounds. This thesis investigates why assets handed over to the owner have failed during operation, and proposes new ways that capabilities can be integrated to reduce and prevent potential operational failure from arising. An abductive reasoning with a grounded theory approach was used over a three-year period, and involved quarterly expert research steering group meetings to validate the iteration between literature and empirical observation to obtain new insights. The first workshop and questionnaire phase of the study created a Cost of Quality (COQ) framework; this was then tested on five multi-case study and subsequently developed within a single expert owner organisation using semi-structured interviews, card sorting and a Delphi review. The results show that the owner and the multi-organisational supply network capabilities are fragmented in addressing operational failure. By identifying and measuring quality cost failure, owners and their supply network will learn and be able to procure more integrated capabilities in failure mitigation for reducing quality cost failure. This will be achieved with better understanding of the relationship between owner’s strategic requirement, technical project delivery and functional operations management capabilities, which is summarised in a capabilities cycle model. The model illustrates the need for a strategic project and quality management approach to integrate capabilities within each phase of a project’s lifecycle. An integrated capabilities approach is proposed for the owner and its multi-organisational supply and operator network to integrate and collaborate in relation to the capabilities required to equally share project risk and quality cost in mitigating the failures.
