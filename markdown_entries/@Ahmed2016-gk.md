## Abstract
This chapter sets the scene for the book and will elaborate on types of research and the thought process of the research journey, from start to finish. The chapter produces a breakdown of three main zones -  the literature review zone (how to be equipped to tackle it), the research methodology zone (how to approach this stage) and the data-collection stage (how to prepare for it). The chapter demonstrates the importance of the introductory chapter of any thesis; the thought process for shaping the introduction to the research (including the abstract) and how the introductory chapter of the thesis could be designed to give an overview of the research and set the scene for the thesis; how to shape the aim and objectives; and how to derive the research problem, which may lead to formulating a research hypothesis or the research questions.
