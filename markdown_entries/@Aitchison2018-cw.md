> As we stand on the cusp of a fundamental restructuring of the housing and building industries, this book provides a timely overview of prefabricated and modular housing. The idea of prefabricated and modular housing is not a new one -  since the 19th century, designers, inventors, engineers, builders, developers, and entrepreneurs have all been fascinated by the idea of the factory-built home. But the current international housing shortages and affordability crises have given a new urgency to the need to transform building construction in the 21st century. Richly illustrated and drawing on historical examples and contemporary design studies, the book takes the reader through the history, theory and design of the prefab, leading up to a discussion of contemporary problems and opportunities. Including a broad international survey, drawing on research from leading experts in the field, and previewing case studies of leading designers and companies, this book suggests a future scenario for industrialized building that will both challenge those professions concerned with the design and production of the built environment, and stimulate the public imagination.
