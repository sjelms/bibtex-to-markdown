## Abstract
Automation in construction manufacturing is becoming increasingly common due to the drive for higher productivity and increased quality. One important consideration in the implementation of automation is the training and maintenance of the equipment. This study proposes an approach to assess the training for assembly/disassembly and maintenance of machines developed for the construction manufacturing industry by using immersive virtual reality (VR).
