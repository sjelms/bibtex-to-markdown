> Summary This chapter explores how vocational teachers? expertise is used, developed, and sustained (over time) in practice. It argues that the development of teachers? expertise in vocational contexts is a complex, diffuse, and largely hidden process, residing both within the individual as personal expertise and/or within networks as shared vocational knowledge. The chapter employs two different but complementary research methodologies (cultural historical activity theory and actor?network theory) as analytical lenses to explore and make visible the phenomenon of vocational practice in action. Examples are given from a range of case studies of both vocational trainee teachers and experienced vocational teachers. The chapter concludes by arguing for new ways to approach the development of vocational teachers? expertise.
