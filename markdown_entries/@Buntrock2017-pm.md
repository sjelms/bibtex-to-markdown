> Japan’s strong role in the factory-built housing industry emerged as a response to World War II. The ministry of international trade and industry established the Japan Prefabricated Construction Suppliers and Manufacturers Association (JPCSMA) in 1964 to promote best practices, develop and disseminate research, and form industry standards. Japan frequently experiences large earthquakes, which killed tens of thousands in the last half-century. Japanese prefabricated housing tends to be sturdy, even overbuilt; steel frames are used in 80 percent of prefabricated housing and concrete is also widely used. Japan’s loose enforcement of building codes, evidenced in several scandals, also damaged homeowners’ confidence in smaller builders. Japan is divided into 47 prefectures, which function something like states; JPCSMA data allows a nuanced understanding of prefabrication’s market penetration. Insulation and energy-efficient doors and windows may soon be required even in Japan’s detached houses.
