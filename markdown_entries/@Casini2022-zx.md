> The chapter provides an introduction to the Construction 4.0 framework and its main components, illustrating how the advent of digitalization, innovative technologies and materials, and new construction techniques, can transform the way that infrastructure, real estate, and other built assets can be designed, constructed, and operated in order to create a more attractive, energy efficient, comfortable, affordable, safe, and sustainable built environment. After an overview on the economic and societal relevance of the construction industry, the chapter focuses on its current labor productivity and safety issues, along with the new megatrends that are affecting the architecture. engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) sector in the third millennium. Energy and environment impacts of buildings and cities are investigated illustrating the main strategies and policies to promote a more sustainable built environment and a new circular economy model for construction. An in-depth presentation of the emerging paradigms of zero energy building, green building, and smart building is also given, highlighting their main characteristics, performances, and design strategies. Finally, the new revolutionary approach to the building process, so-called Construction 4.0, is presented, showing the new opportunities and benefits offered by the new digital technologies for the whole AECO value chain and how these are giving rise to a new era for the industry, to increase its productivity and, at the same time, to address emergent global challenges such as resource shortage, climate change and increase of global population.
