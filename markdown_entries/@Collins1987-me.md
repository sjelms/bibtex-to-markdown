> It is only in the last century, and only in industrialized nations, that formal schooling has emerged as a widespread method of educating the young. Before schools, apprenticeship was the most common means of learning, used to transmit the knowledge required for expert practice in fields from painting and sculpting to medicine and law. Even today, many complex and important skills, such as those required for language use and social interaction, are learned informally through apprenticeshiplike methods--i.e., methods involving not didactic teaching, but observation, coaching, and successive approximation while carrying out a variety of tasks and activities. The differences between formal schooling and apprenticeship methods are many, but for our purposes, one is most important. Perhaps as a by-product of the specialization of learning in schools, skills and knowledge taught in schools have become abstracted from their uses in the world. In apprenticeship learning, on the other hand, target skills are not only continually in use by skilled practitioners, but are instrumental to the accomplishment of meaningful tasks. Said differently, apprenticeship embeds the learning of skills and knowledge in the social and functional context of their use. This difference is not academic, but has serious implications for the nature of the knowledge that students acquire. This paper attempts to elucidate some of those implications through a proposal for the retooling of apprenticeship methods for the teaching and learning of cognitive skills. Specifically, we propose the development of a new cognitive apprenticeship to teach students the thinking and problem-solving skills involved in school subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics. The organization of the paper is as follows -  In the first section, we discuss briefly what we believe to be key shortcomings in current curricular and pedagogical practices. We then present some of the structural features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss, in general, what would be required to adapt these characteristics to the teaching and learning of cognitive skills. In the second section we consider in detail three recently developed pedagogical ``success models,'' which we believe exemplify aspects of apprenticeship methods in teaching the thinking and reasoning skills involved in reading, writing and mathematics. We attempt to show how and why these methods are successful with regard to the development of not only the cognitive, but also the metacognitive, skills requited for true expertise. In the final section, we organize our ideas on the purposes and characteristics of successful teaching into a general framework for the design of learning environments, where ``environment'' includes the content being taught, the pedagogical methods employed, the sequencing of learning activities, and the sociology of learning. This framework emphasizes how cognitive apprenticeship goes beyond the techniques of traditional apprenticeship. We hope it will be useful to the field in designing, evaluating, and doing research on pedagogical methods, materials, and technologies.
