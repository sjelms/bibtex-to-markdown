## Abstract
For Apprenticeships to offer great opportunities for people of all ages, they must be of the highest quality. High quality will mean that those undertaking apprenticeships have confidence that the skills they are learning will help them succeed, progress and thrive. And it means that employers will see the bottom-line return of a workforce with the right knowledge, skills and behaviours.
