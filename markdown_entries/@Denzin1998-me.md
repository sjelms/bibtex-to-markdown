In this, the second of a three-volume paperback version of the landmark Handbook of Qualitative Research, editors Norman K Denzin and Yvonna S Lincoln consider the major strategies employed by the qualitative researcher. Starting from the research design process and following through to consider a range of methods that can be applied in any study, Strategies of Qualitative Inquiry covers funding, case studies, ethnography, grounded theory, participative inquiry and much more - offering a range of methods that can be employed in any study. The outstanding contributors thoroughly covereach topic, enriching the qualitative experience. The Handbook of Qualitative Research has been heralded as the state of the art in evaluating the field of qualitative inquiry and features contributions from some of the leading scholars in the area. Now published in paperback in response to the needs of classroom teachers, Strategies of Qualitative Inquiry will also be an excellent choice around which to build a course on research methods, across a wide number of academic disciplines.
