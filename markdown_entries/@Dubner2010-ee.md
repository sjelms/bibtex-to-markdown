> [!abstract]
> Steven Levitt, the original rogue economist, and Stephen Dubner have spent four years uncovering the hidden side of even more controversial subjects, from terrorism to shark attacks, cable TV to hurricanes. The result is Superfreakonomics. It reveals, among other things -  - Why you are more likely to be killed walking drunk than driving drunk - How a prostitute is more likely to sleep with a policeman than be arrested by one- Why terrorists might be easier to track down than you would imagine- How a sex change could boost your salaryBecause sometimes the most superfreaky solution is the simplest.
