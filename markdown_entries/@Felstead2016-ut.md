> This report provides a summary of the evidence base on the question -  'What learning happens in the workplace, and how is it recognised?'. It draws on national and international research findings - both quantitative and qualitative - and identifies ten key messages -  (1) The starting points are to recognise that -  (a) paradigms of learning differ; and (b) workplaces are contested spaces in which what counts as 'learning'; (2) Measures of 'learning as acquisition' include the incidence of workplace training; (3) Real levels of training expenditure by employers have also moved downwards; (4) Despite the emphasis placed on training course attendance and the acquisition of qualifications, both are relatively low-rated by employees in terms of their helpfulness in improving work performance; (5) At a time when formal workplace training has been declining, the evidence suggests that the importance of learning on-the-job is rising; (6) All sources of workplace learning from whatever paradigm are skewed towards those at the top of the occupational hierarchy; (7) Much of the qualitative evidence shows that learning occurs naturally in all workplaces as part of everyday activity in line with the learning as participation approach; (8) Workplace learning takes many forms stretching across a 'formal-informal' continuum; (9) International research evidence suggests that the key inter-related determinants in the variability of workplace learning environments are context and individual behaviour; and (10) External recognition and accreditation of workplace learning is problematic due to its largely collective and dynamic nature.
