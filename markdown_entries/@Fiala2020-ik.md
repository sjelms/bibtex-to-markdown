## Abstract
Improvement of work safety measures and trainings are important elements to enhance the sensibility for hazardous situations and decrease work accidents. Virtual reality (VR) simulation-based trainings have been shown to be a promising approach to support experience-based learning, as the virtual environments can simulate realistic work environments. To investigate to which extent reflective learning can be supported by using VR simulations, this exploratory study combines a VR simulation on a construction site with subsequent semi-structured interviews to induce reflections in participants. Results of the qualitative content analysis show, that a reflection process about work safety aspects benefits from combining VR simulation with a subsequent interview. Numerous reflections on the content of the simulation coupled to own past (real-life) experience were induced, indicating the tested combination to be a promising learning approach to teach work safety aspects that may help to raise the awareness about work safety at construction sites.
