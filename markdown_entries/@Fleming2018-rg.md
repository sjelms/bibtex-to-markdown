> Over the last 20 years, research focused on work-integrated learning (WIL) has expanded considerably. While early research predominantly utilized quantitative study designs, recently a more diverse set of methodologies is being used to address questions and issues arising from a range of WIL models. This Special Issue is intended to present different methodologies available to WIL researchers. The papers include case studies of how these methodologies, and methods within, are being used for WIL research, along with discussion of the strengths and limitations of using the research approach. Examples of case study methodology, multiple case studies, mixed methods, program evaluation research, hermeneutic phenomenology, grounded theory, reflective practice as research, and large-scale data mining, provide insights into different ways of addressing research questions. In this issue, the advantages and challenges faced by those conducting research as 'insiders' within their own organizations are also examined. Specifically, within this paper the importance of ethical conduct while engaging with research, especially WIL research using human participants, is discussed, including the need to obtain ethical approval and consideration of issues around informed consent, conflict of interest, risk of harm and confidentiality.
