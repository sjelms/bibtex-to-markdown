> This report presents findings from a study which examined the extent to which occupational identity underpins contemporary apprenticeships in England, and the implications for policy and practice of the decoupling of apprenticeship from the concept of occupation. The study focused on the [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] STEM-related sectors of the economy, and addressed the following research questions -  How is the concept of occupation and occupational identity defined and characterised in the research literature? How many government-supported Advanced and Higher Apprenticeship frameworks can be regarded as being STEM-related? To what extent are these STEM-related frameworks built around a concept of occupation? The study concludes that, whilst there are some high quality apprenticeships in England, particularly in fields related to engineering and technology, the 'anything goes' approach to the inclusion of job titles and job roles across and within frameworks has created a highly inconsistent and overly complex system.
