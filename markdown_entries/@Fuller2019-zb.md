> Summary This chapter asks what an occupation means under contemporary social, economic, and policy conditions and examines the strength and nature of the relationship between education, training, and occupation. It reviews key historical aspects of socioeconomic and institutional change that underpin debates about the concept of occupation and its changing relationship with apprenticeship. The discussion draws on two contrasting examples to illustrate how different concepts of occupation affect the nature and quality of the associated apprenticeships. The chapter argues that in the context of mass higher education, programs of publicly funded vocational learning (including apprenticeships) and the qualifications associated with them need to generate hybrid benefits, through providing a vehicle for the achievement of occupational expertise and educational progression.
