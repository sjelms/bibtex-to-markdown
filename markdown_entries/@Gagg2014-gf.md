## Abstract
Today, second only to water, concrete is the most consumed material, with three tonnes per year used for every person in the world. Twice as much concrete is used in construction as all other building materials combined. There is little doubt that concrete will remain in use as a construction material well into the future. However, with such extensive use of the material, discovery of any shortcoming or problem associated with concrete or reinforced concrete structures will become a matter of considerable public concern – both from a safety perspective and associated costs of rectification. Accordingly, this paper will initially review the historic development of cements and concrete and will then focus on the mechanical response of concrete and reinforced concrete to its working environment. At appropriate points within the narrative, case study input will be used to illustrate or highlight principal themes.
