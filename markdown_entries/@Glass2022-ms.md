> What does “transforming” construction mean? – Where is it, who is doing the transforming, and how (and when) do we know it is happening? In Construction Management and Economics and elsewhere, there is a longstanding discussion amongst scholars on the topic of innovation in construction – but what of transformation in construction? Is it different, and if so – how? We set out with this Special Issue to answer these questions and advance the theoretical understanding of the transformation of the built environment, and how this requires the construction industry to transform accordingly. We believe that a “transforming construction” research agenda entails a multi-scalar perspective and therefore called for papers on industry-level transforming, firm-level transforming, and project- and programme-level transforming. We also recognise the process focus in contemporary social science through our framing of “transforming” construction as never-ending, and by seeking out accounts of how this is unfolding in practice. This resulting Special Issue will hopefully act as a provocation for new perspectives on transforming construction -  it attempts to revisit, re-evaluate, and re-invent how we conceptualise both construction and construction research. The eight papers build on a strong legacy of research on innovation in construction management, while providing new insights on what is being transformed and how; locating, albeit tentatively, where the future debates are; and identifying spaces where rich data may be found. Readers will find a stimulating range of conceptual thinking and empirical evidence being brought to bear on change, innovation, and transformation, with extensive discussion of implications for future research on construction policy, projects, and people, broadening our field of view and drawing out strong new ideas to guide practice. The structure of this Editorial is as follows. First, we provide a synthetic recap of key themes within the transforming construction topic, as outlined in the Call for Papers. Secondly, we summarise the content of the eight accepted papers, positioning each paper under one of three headings, which reflect the multi-scale perspective of the Special Issue and as presented previously in the Call for Papers. We then go on to a discussion section, in which we set out what we see as five major themes emerging from the papers, characterising what transforming construction looks like from the perspective of these authors. There is a conclusion section to identify what the editorial team feels are the most pertinent reflections and questions, in a bid to offer some direction to future research in the area, followed by a short commentary on some limitations of the Special Issue.
