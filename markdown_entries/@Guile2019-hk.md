> Summary This chapter examines the impact of new technologies and the increasing economic importance of ?intangible assets? in the nature of work processes and conceptions of expertise to argue for a new conceptualization of the relationship between work, expertise, and vocational education and training (VET). This new prospective approach is in contrast to the existing skill-based retrospective approach, which has come to dominate VET research and policymaking. VET has paid a price for becoming overly institutionalized within national education and training systems and, as a consequence, initial preparation of young people for the labor market. We argue that a close relationship to future work practice is vital to ensure VET can sustain its important role in the development of expertise.
