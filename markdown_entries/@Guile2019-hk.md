## Abstract
Summary This chapter examines the impact of new technologies and the increasing economic importance of ?intangible assets? in the nature of work processes and conceptions of expertise to argue for a new conceptualization of the relationship between work, expertise, and vocational education and training (VET). This new prospective approach is in contrast to the existing skill-based retrospective approach, which has come to dominate VET research and policymaking. VET has paid a price for becoming overly institutionalized within national education and training systems and, as a consequence, initial preparation of young people for the labor market. We argue that a close relationship to future work practice is vital to ensure VET can sustain its important role in the development of expertise.
