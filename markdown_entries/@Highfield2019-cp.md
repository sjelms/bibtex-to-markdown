## Abstract
Seeking to enhance its existing safety material, leading architecture, engineering and construction firm Haskell has partnered with Kennesaw State University’s College of Computing and Software Engineering on developing an innovative virtual reality training aid. The project, known as the Hazard Elimination/Risk Oversight (HERO) program, is an immersive simulation that teleports users into a virtual construction site riddled with potential hazards in an effort to reinforce safety training among its employees.
