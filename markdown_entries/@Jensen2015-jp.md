> Construction is traditionally a trade that produces unique, one-off products designed specifically for individual projects via an engineer-to-order process. However, recently developed flexible product platforms based on the theory of mass customisation offer product flexibility with affordable costs. The degree of commonality between products can also be increased by applying the products-in-products concept. This study aims to conceptualise and test theories of mass customisation through modularisation for applications in the construction industry. Three case studies on building and infrastructure construction projects using different specification processes (modify-to-order, configure-to-order and select-variant) are presented. The results show that the products-in-products concept is useful for enabling mass customisation in construction. While select-variant specification is compatible with relatively integral designs, the architecture must have a modular structure to enable modify-to-order or configure-to-order customisation.
