## Abstract
Organisational culture has been a long-standing debate in management research. However, in the field of construction project management, it is relatively under-explored. This is mainly due to the different organisational context of Temporary Multi-Organisations (TMOs). This research re-explores the notion of organisational culture in construction projects. Based on Darwin’s theory of evolution this research goes back to the very beginning; illustrating the exact meaning and dynamics of organisational culture in a construction TMO’s ecosystem. This research view an organisation and its forming of culture(s) as part of an evolutionary process. Thus, a critical realist’ view of causation is used as the foundation of the research design and methodology. Case study materials are provided from three Alliancing TMOs belonging to two major infrastructure clients in the UK. A designer culture model and the institutional theory are drawn upon to complement the basis of analysis for evolution. A qualitative research method is employed through semi-structured interviews and pre- and post-interview meetings. Other supporting documentations are also consulted. Three propositions and a postulate are generated and examined against the empirical data. Findings suggest that (i) the TMOs’ culture evolves through a set of recursive stages across the project lifecycle, (ii) the culture of the TMO undergoes several lifecycles during one lifespan of the project, and (iii) there are some evidence that culture at TMO level is learned, rationalised and routinised at corporate level. The postulate shows that it is plausible to predict the trajectory of how a TMO’s culture will evolve across the project lifecycle given a set of organisational features. In practice, findings suggest that hard artifacts alone are not able to sustain established culture throughout the projec
