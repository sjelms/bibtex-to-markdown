## Abstract
A long-term strategy for economic survival in industrial construction requires the integration of multiple disciplines, including market knowledge, construction technology, production engineering, design, construction planning, logistics, and quality. This book takes the perspective of the house builder and contractor, describing methods for successfully integrating these components and how this enhances the overall value. The authors also provide an overview of the history of industrial construction. They then introduce methods and concepts that form the foundation for successful industrial construction—methods that can also be applied to other areas of the construction industry. Understanding industrial construction also enhances comprehension of business relationships within the broader construction sector.
