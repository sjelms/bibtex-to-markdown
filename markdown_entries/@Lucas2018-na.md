## Abstract
Work-integrated learning (WIL) research is heavily steeped in particular contexts making it highly suited to flexible, multiple perspective methodologies, such as case study. However, case study methodology is often criticized for being too specific, not generalizable and limited in what it can contribute to theory. In addition, there is often confusion between the meaning and application of the terms method and methodology. This paper presents an argument to help guide and support researchers who are considering a case study approach to their WIL research. Two vignettes demonstrate how researchers overcame some of the alleged limitations of case study as a methodology and utilized the benefits to advance the theory and practice of WIL. Case study provides a sound methodology that can reflect the variability of research contexts and enables a flexible approach to address a wide range of research questions that are relevant to the evolving nature of WIL.
