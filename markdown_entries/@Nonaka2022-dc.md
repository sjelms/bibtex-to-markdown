## Abstract
Management theorist Professor Nonaka and phenomenologist Professor Yamaguchi discuss the relationship between art and science. According to them, scientific objectivity always comes from subjective experience of human beings, and meaning and values are the most fundamental condition for human existence. However, we now live in the “meaningless” and “value-less” world dominated by the natural sciences where “objectivity” is valued over subjectivity and many of us are feeling disoriented in our lives. Husserl’s phenomenology gives us an insight to overcome this existential challenge in the way that is deeply connected to Nonaka’s management studies.
