## Abstract
Intelligent tutoring refers to computer-based instructional systems that are founded on the assumption that learning based on individualized instruction by a competent tutor is far superior to classroom-style group instruction. Good human tutors are ‘intelligent tutors’ because they are able to continously adapt the content and style of their instruction to best meet the needs of the learner. The historical evolution of intelligent tutoring systems is presented. The starting point was programmed instruction in the late 1960s, followed by knowledge-based tutors that try to simulate good human tutors by the integrated use of domain knowledge, teaching knowledge, and knowledge about the individual student. Finally some important current trends like distance learning, collaborative learning, and Web-based learning are outlined. The presentation is given within a cognitive science point of view. From this perspective the research on intelligent tutoring has shown many fruitful interactions between academic research and application-oriented research with regard to topics like knowledge representation, computerized assessment of knowledge, learning and knowledge acquisition, and expertise research.
