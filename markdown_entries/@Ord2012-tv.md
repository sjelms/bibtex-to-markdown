> Whilst experiential learning is an increasingly established aspect of youth work practice, in the main it is dominated by a simplistic four stage cycle which is attributed to Kolb (1984). However, it will be demonstrated in this article that this is a misinterpretation of Kolb's theory which results in a limited view of 'experience' within experiential learning. It is argued that not only a deeper understanding of Kolb's original theory is required, but a return must be made to John Dewey, perhaps the architect of experiential learning, to fully comprehend its importance. In so doing, a fuller appreciation of young people's experience is acquired, as well as a wider theoretical basis established for existing youth work practice.
