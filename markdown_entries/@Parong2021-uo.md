## Abstract
This chapter reviews media comparison research on the effects of various immersive technologies, including virtual reality and two types of mixed reality, augmented reality and augmented virtuality, on learning outcomes, as well as some boundary conditions for these effects. In sum, previous meta-analyses report that low immersion virtual reality (d = .22–.41) and low immersion augmented reality (d = .46–.68) improve learning outcomes compared to other instructional media, with small-to-medium-sized effects. However, high immersion virtual reality (median d = .10) and high immersion augmented reality (median d = .16) are less promising. Research on augmented virtuality is sparse, but shows positive effects on learning (median d = .45) based on a few studies. Theoretical implications of these immersive technologies regarding cognitive frameworks, as well as their practical implications on the future of technology in the classroom, are discussed.
