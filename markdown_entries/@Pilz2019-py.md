## Abstract
Summary This chapter explores the concepts of duality and ?learning fields? in vocational education and training (VET). This is understood in many countries to provide the optimal basis for organizing VET programs, although the degree to which this is achieved in practice varies considerably. The chapter explores the challenges in achieving duality through the lens of the German dual system. It focuses on the relationship between theory and practice and approaches to curriculum development, VET pedagogy, and assessment. The chapter concludes with reflections on the implications of increasing student diversity for the professional development of VET teachers and trainers.
