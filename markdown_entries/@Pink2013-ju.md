## Abstract
In this article, we explore how short-term theoretically informed ethnography is emerging as an approach to doing research that is contemporary in both its subject matter and in its use for applied research projects designed to lead to informed interventions in the world. We argue that far from being a quick and dirty' route to doing qualitative research, short-term ethnography is characterized by forms of intensity that lead to deep and valid ways of knowing.
