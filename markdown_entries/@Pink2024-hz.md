## Abstract
When ‘ADHD wife’ Rox and neurotypical husband Rich asked their community of 2.5 million what the biggest ADHD struggle is, the thousands of replies changed everything. As they learned, the real enemy isn’t productivity or focus, but the toxic ADHD core beliefs we’ve internalised. With candour and kindness, they share personal stories to highlight and reframe the 10 big lies that ADHD people believe about themselves. From ‘I am lazy’ to ‘Everybody hates me’ and ‘I quit everything I start’, Small Talk will empower ADHDers and those who love them to navigate life with compassion, humour and hope. Whether you were diagnosed early or are new to the neurospicy community, Small Talk will change your relationship with yourself and others. It will help you to stop being your worst fear-leader, start bigging yourself up, and live your best neurodivergent life. Learn how to -  Identify your limiting ADHD beliefs Break free from neurotypical standards Support and understand your ADHDers Adopt a self-kindness mindset Communicate your needs \and boundaries Celebrate the joys of ADHD \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Praise for Dirty Laundry -  'A godsend!'
