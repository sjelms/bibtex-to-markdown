> This book explores the applications of virtual reality technologies in building design and offsite construction. Its focus is on how small and medium-sized architectural and construction practices with limited budgets and time can implement innovation through visualisation creation. Virtual reality technologies, known as empathy machines, offer a productive interaction process for clients and professionals. Gaming and simulation have already proven their efficacy in solving problems in science and business. However, the next challenge is designing data-rich virtual environments that can enhance clients' spatial understanding, simplify architect-client communications, provide customisation options, consolidate quantification, and export data directly to manufacturers' software, minimizing fragmentation across the entire building information management (BIM) lifecycle. With this book, architects and construction professionals can learn how to leverage virtual reality technologies to improve their work processes and enhance client engagement. Whether you're new to virtual reality or an experienced practitioner, this book provides valuable insights and practical tips to help you harness the power of this exciting technology.
