## Abstract
There is widespread recognition that changing technologies and ways of working are increasing the importance of workforce skills and the need for skill upgrading. Yet despite a long history of research on training in the fields of organizational psychology, human resources, and labor economics, little is known about the state-of-the-art in training practices offered by employers, use of training opportunities by employees, or the effects of training and upskilling on critical outcomes for workers or employers. This report seeks to start filling this void by describing what we believe to be a state-of-the-art learning system at IBM Corporation and tracing the effects of learning on job performance and career advancement.
