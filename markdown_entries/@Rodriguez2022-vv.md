> Is online space real space? Does it, should it and can it work in the same way and follow the same rules? This is a big question that couldn’t possibly be answered in one episode, so we thought we’d be a bit more specific and ask, what does, or should, an online classroom look like? Alongside two innovative educators from The Bartlett School of Architecture, host Christoph explores their personal experiences of teaching during the pandemic and ideas around how we might reinvent what a classroom looks like in the future. Join Elizabeth Dow, an Associate Professor and Senior Departmental Tutor who leads the Architectural & Interdisciplinary Studies BSc and Alvaro Lopez-Rodriguez, a lecturer (teaching) and researcher in digital manufacturing and augmented reality for a reflective discussion on the possibilities - and limitations - of online teaching.
