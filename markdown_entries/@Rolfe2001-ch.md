## Abstract
Critical reflection, like all practice based skills, can only be mastered by doing it. This practical user's guide takes the reader through a structured and coherent course in reflective practice, with frequent reflective writing exercises, discussion breaks and suggestions for further reading. With chapters on individual and group supervision, reflective writing, research and education, this book should be of interest to students and practitioners at all levels of nursing, midwifery, health visiting and social work.
