> A comparable scale to the North American modular industry was achieved in the Soviet Union during the 1960s, with a number of systems consisting of volumetric components of reinforced concrete, but this modular system has never achieved the gargantuan scale of application of Soviet panelized systems. As a housing delivery system, the modular industry usually works directly with small and medium-sized builders, particularly in the Northeast, offering conventional light wood framing and sheet rock hanging, as well as fully prefabricated assemblies, such as windows and doors customized to each order. Connect Homes, a modular housing delivery system developed by two architects, Gordon Stott and Jared Levy, is deeply informed by the earlier experiences of the system’s authors’ work at Marmol Radziner, as well as a critical examination of the logics of the modular industry and the intermodal shipping container. In the Northeast, the modular industry has acknowledged the fact that growth will occur primarily in the delivery of multi-unit housing.
