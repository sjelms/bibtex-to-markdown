> [!abstract]
> This report, commissioned by the previous UK government's housing ministry, examines the role of investment demand for UK housing and its contribution to worsening affordability over the past 40 years. The report examines how government policies in the spheres of financial regulation, property taxation, and housing policy have contributed to the ‘financialisation’ of housing, with its role as an investment good overriding the UK population’s housing needs. The UK has become locked into a “housing-finance feedback cycle” where increasing financial flows into housing generate rising prices, and expectations of future rises , which in turn generate more speculative demand for housing as an investment. This includes buy-to-let and second homes, with 1-in-5 homes in the UK now owned by landlords, and homeownership for younger cohorts in rapid decline.
