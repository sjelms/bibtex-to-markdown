> Construction 4.0 is the adoption and adaptation of the Industry 4.0 framework for the construction sector. Industry 4.0 promises to revolutionize how ‘things’ are made by using physical and digital technologies in an integrated manner. Similarly, the authors envision that the Construction 4.0 framework can fundamentally change the way that assets are designed, constructed, and operated. The idea of the Construction 4.0 developed from the need of the construction sector to overcome the existing horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal fragmentation and to take a holistic approach to the improvements needed in the industry. In this study, a literature review of Industry 4.0 and its influence on the construction sector was undertaken. Based on this systematic literature review, the authors define the Construction 4.0 framework and provide its benefits and barriers to implementation. A key finding of the study is that building information modeling, and a common data environment form the key foundation for the implementation of the Construction 4.0 framework. In defining the Construction 4.0 framework, the paper described its components and how its implementation is likely to proceed. The authors envision that by adopting Construction 4.0, the industry can transform itself into a highly efficient, quality-centered, and safe industry capable of successfully delivering the demands placed on it by society.
