> [!abstract]
> Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have been authored to support desktop applications with the most common domains involving cognitive problem solving (eg, mathematics and physics) in which sets of problems are presented to the learner with increasing complexity and decreasing tutor support as learning progresses. In recent years, implementations of game-based tutors based on the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT; Sottilare, Brawner, Goldberg & Holden, 2012), an open-source tutoring architecture, have …
