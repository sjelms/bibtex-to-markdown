## Abstract
Summary This chapter explores the connections between training and development and industrial relations. As the skills agenda has moved to the forefront of public conversation, in a practical sense training and development have become more of an industrial relations concern, as policymakers exhort the social actors to cooperate and build new partnership relations around skills, training, and learning to help address the challenges of building more productive economies. The chapter considers the conceptual underpinnings of the industrial relations of training, before reviewing developments in the British training system, notably in terms of trade union?led learning initiatives, within a more comparative context. The analysis suggests that the industrial relations of training are heavily influenced by the institutional structures and legacies that help to regulate potential conflicts of interest around training and development. However, ?mutual gains? are increasingly challenging, even in the traditionally more coordinated economies.
