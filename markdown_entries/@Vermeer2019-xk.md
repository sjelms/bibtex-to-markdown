> This thesis investigates how organizations in strategic Public Private Partnership (PPP) procurement systems—specifically through Local Education Partnerships (LEPs) in England—collectively learn to improve delivery of social infrastructure projects. It addresses a gap in understanding how collective learning occurs in complex, hybrid organizations formed by both public and private entities. Drawing from organizational learning and systems thinking, the study uses mixed methods to evaluate 12 LEPs and 600 schools under the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) program. It introduces the Asset Value Enhancement Model (AVEM) as a framework for embedding collective learning throughout project lifecycles. The research highlights that sustained learning contributes significantly to achieving better whole-life value for money and environmental sustainability in infrastructure delivery.
