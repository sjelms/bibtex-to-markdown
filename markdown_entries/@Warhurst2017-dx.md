## Abstract
This chapter is part of a volume that draws on a wide range of disciplines to examine the major issues concerning skills and training in contemporary times. Social construction of skills, whether old or new, raises basic questions about how skill is analysed and changes the nature of work and the balance of workplace power. The authors examine how the social construction of skills has changed in recent years with shifts in the balance of power between capital and labour and how the new social construction of skills affects different types of workers by sex, class, and race, variously helping and hindering the employment prospects of these workers. It is argued that the social construction of skill constitutes the principal and growing portion of employment discrimination today.
