## Abstract
“Sophia, do you believe in God?” No little girl should answer this or other questions about her life here, but this question was aimed at a humanoid robot lady. It was developed by Hanson Robotics in Hong Kong and presented at the United Nations on October 11, 2017. On October 25, 2017, Saudi Arabia even granted her citizenship. When she appears at various trade fairs and exhibitions, she can conduct simple, pre-programmed conversations through artificial intelligence (AI). However, questions such as those about her cultural preferences, beliefs, life, love, freedom, and ultimately death remain unanswered.
