## Abstract
Summary Societies and economies all over the world are currently experiencing substantial transformations driven by, among other factors, the rise of new digital technologies. These transformations are going to fundamentally change all aspects of our private, social, and professional lives, and will also have substantial influences on vocational education and training (VET). The goal of this chapter is to demonstrate how these technologies can be used to effectively support learning and teaching processes in this educational field. We start by introducing the potentials and affordances of technologies as a means to connect different learning locations and provide a set of examples of prototypical uses of several technologies as boundary-crossing tools.
