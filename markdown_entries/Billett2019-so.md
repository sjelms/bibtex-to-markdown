## Abstract
Summary Understanding the purposes, processes, and outcomes of vocational education necessitates placing individuals centrally in those deliberations. The geneses of national vocational education systems, and their form, goals, and practices, are increasingly shaped by institutional factors, which Dewey (1916) refers to as the ?social side.? They extend to the provision of detailed national prespecified outcomes, course content, forms of assessment, and so on. Yet, the efficacy and continuity of these educational provisions arise in response to how individuals engage, learn, and remake them?what Dewey refers to as the ?personal side??albeit in interdependent ways. That is, there is mutual dependence between the personal and social sides. Regardless of whether it is directed to pragmatic purposes or educational efficacy, vocational education relies on individual experiencing and engagement, interdependently. Ultimately, individuals enact vocational education provisions, learn from and through them, prompt changes within them, and realize their intended purposes.
