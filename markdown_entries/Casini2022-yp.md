## Abstract
Developments in data acquisition technologies, digital information and analysis, automated construction processes, and advanced materials and products have finally started to move the construction industry - traditionally reluctant to innovation and slow in adopting new technologies - toward a new era. Massive changes are occurring because of the possibilities created by Building information modeling, Extended reality, Internet of Things, Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning, Big data, Nanotechnology, 3D printing, and other advanced technologies, which are strongly interconnected and are driving the capabilities for much more efficient construction at scale. Construction 4.0 -  Advanced Technology, Tools and Materials for the Digital Transformation of the Construction Industry provides readers with a state-of-the-art review of the ongoing digital transformation of the sector within the new 4.0 framework, presenting a thorough investigation of the emerging trends, technologies, and strategies in the fields of smart building design, construction, and operation and providing a comprehensive guideline on how to exploit the new possibilities offered by the digital revolution. It will be an essential reference resource for academic researchers, material scientists and civil engineers, undergraduate and graduate students, and other professionals working in the field of smart ecoefficient construction and cutting-edge technologies applied to construction. Provides an overview of the Construction 4.0 framework to address the global challenges of the building sector in the 21st century and an in-depth analysis of the most advanced digital technologies and systems for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure, real estate, and other built assets Covers major innovations across the value chain, including building design, fabrication, construction, operation and maintenance, and end-of-life Illustrates the most advanced digital tools and methods to support the building design activity, including generative design, virtual reality, and digital fabrication Presents a thorough review of the most advanced construction materials, building methods, and techniques for a new connected and automated construction model Explores the digital transformation for smart energy buildings and their integration with emerging smart grids and smart cities Reflects upon major findings and identifies emerging market opportunities for the whole AECO sector
