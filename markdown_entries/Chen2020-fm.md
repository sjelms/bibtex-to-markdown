## Abstract
An adaptive guidance system that supports equipment operators requires a comprehensive model of task and user behavior that considers different skill and knowledge levels as well as diverse situations. In this study, we investigated the relationships between user behaviors and skill levels under operational conditions. We captured sixty samples of two sewing tasks performed by five operators using a head-mounted RGB-d camera and a static gaze tracker. We examined the operators’ gaze and head movements, and hand interactions to essential regions (hotspots) to determine behavioral differences among continuous skill improving experiences. The experimental results indicate that some features, such as task execution time and user head movements, are good indexes for skill level and provide valuable information that can be applied to obtain an effective task model. Operators with varying knowledge and operating habits demonstrate different operational features, which can contribute to the design of user-specific guidance.
