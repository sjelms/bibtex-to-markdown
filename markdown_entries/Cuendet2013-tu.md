## Abstract
There have been many claims that Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) can positively impact learning. Alleged benefits include increased usability, improved engagement and collaboration among students, and enhanced perception of tasks, particularly spatial ones. However, little empirical data exists to support these claims. Moreover, despite their potential benefits for learning, TUIs remain scarcely used in schools. This thesis explores these issues within the specific context of vocational education and training for carpenter apprentices. The learning objectives focus on spatial skills, particularly the mapping between 2D and 3D representations. We examine (1) whether TUIs can support the training of spatial skills and, if so, what features enable them to do so, and (2) what kinds of classroom pedagogical scenarios TUIs can support. This research follows a design-based approach and includes empirical studies, primarily conducted in classroom settings.
