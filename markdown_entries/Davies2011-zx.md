## Abstract
In order to understand architecture in all its cultural complexity it is necessary to grasp such basic concepts as representation, form and space. The aim of this book is to provide teachers, students, practising architects and general readers with a set of ideas that will enrich their conversation, their writing, and above all their thinking about architecture. The book is divided into eight chapters, each covering a particular aspect of architecture, and introduces difficult concepts gradually. Architectural theorists and philosophers are mentioned in passing and their works are listed in the bibliography, but they are not the subject of the book. Architecture, rather than philosophy, is at the centre of the picture. The aim is to enable the reader to understand architecture in all its aspects, rather than to learn the names of particular theorists. Written in a conversational style, Thinking about Architecture is an invaluable and accessible standard introduction to architectural theory.
