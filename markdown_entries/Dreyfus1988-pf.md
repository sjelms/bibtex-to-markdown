## Abstract
Heburt L. Drefyus discusses and debates the use of computers in education in this book that proves to be “crucial in the development of computer technology” (Terry Winograd, Associate Professor of Computer Science, Stanford University).Arguing the power of human intuition over the technical strengths of computer technology, Hubert and Stuart Drefyus present a stunning reaffirmation of human intelligence. A compelling approach to inferiority of binary logic, Mind Over Machine presents a reassuring argument that human intuition and expertise will remain far more valuable than technology develops.
