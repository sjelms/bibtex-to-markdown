## Abstract
Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
workplaces âe`` ranging from offices, factories and shops to
gyms, health centres and universities âe'' and how it can be
improved. Such learning includes everyday work activity,
on-the-job instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving
Working as Learning is the first book to analyze systematically
learning at work in different settings by developing and applying
a new analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework
connects the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are
organized and the wider pressures and constraints organizations
face for survival, growth and development. The authors
convincingly demonstrate that the framework offers a
sophisticated understanding of how improving the work environment
âe`` both within the workplace and beyond âe'' can enhance and
sustain improvements in learning at work. Each chapter presents
evidence âe`` taken from both private and public sectors âe'' to
illustrate how the Working as Learning Framework provides a means
by which employers, researchers and policy-makers can Improve the
conditions for nurturing and sustaining learning at workBuild
appropriate workforce development plans within given
constraintsRecognize that the creation and use of knowledge is
widely distributedMobilize existing workplace resources to
support learningEnhance and extend our understanding of how
workplace learning is shaped by relationships at, and beyond, the
workplace This topical book will appeal to an international
readership of undergraduate and postgraduate students, vocational
teachers and trainers, human resource professionals,
policy-makers, and researchers.
