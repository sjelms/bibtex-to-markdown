## Abstract
This chapter argues that the productive systems of contemporary workplaces give rise to many different forms of knowledge creation and use, and, as a consequence, to different forms of learning and pedagogical approaches. Some of these approaches are utilized to the benefit of the organization and employees (though not, necessarily, in a reciprocal manner), but others are buried within everyday workplace activity (see Billett, 2001).
