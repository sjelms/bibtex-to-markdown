## Abstract
How should we train? What should we learn? What is our value? Disruptive technologies have increased speculation about what it means to be an architect. Innovations simultaneously offer great promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume identifies the game-changing trends driven by technology, and the opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and design. It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological models and systems. It features new developments in automation, generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism, artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing evolving research, it discusses the cultural, social, environmental and political implications of various technological trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon future urban, spatial, aesthetic and formal possibilities within architecture. The future is already here. Now is the time to act.
