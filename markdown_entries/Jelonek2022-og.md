## Abstract
The construction industry is one of the sectors with the highest accident rates. To prevent accidents, construction workers receive occupational safety training and safety instructions. However, experience-based learning of dangerous situations is hardly possible or justifiable in reality. Virtual reality (VR) simulations can be a potential solution in this regard by allowing workers to experience dangerous situations in a very vivid but safe way without being exposed to real hazards. In this study, a VR simulation for construction safety training was developed and tested with trainees that learn the safe operation of hand-operated power tools. In this particular case study, the objective for the participants in the VR simulation was to successfully consider all safety aspects in the operation of an angle grinder. The usability, user experience and implicit learning were investigated during the study. Additionally, we conducted post-play interviews with participants. Results found learning effects of participants as well as a satisfying user experience and usability. The results also show that participants might learn content as presented, risking the learning of false information if the simulation does not cover relevant safety aspects.
