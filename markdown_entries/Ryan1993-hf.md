## Abstract
[A synthetic retrospective study was designed using 1990-91 educational recordsfrom the South Carolina Department of Youth Services. The sample consisted of 100\% of the participants enrolled in the General Educational Development (GED) program. The study was designed to test the following hypothesis -  The odds of voluntary participation in a literacy program was higher for participants who achieved academically than the odds of mandatory participation in a literacy program for participants who achieved academically, controlling for race, sex, age, IQ, and education. Crude Odds Rations were used to determine the relationship between type of participant and academic achievement. Adjusted Odds Ratios were utilized to show the relationship between the independent variables and voluntary participation. Multiple Logistic Regression was utilized to show the odds ratio along with the 95\% Confidence Interval for the association between voluntary participation and academic achievement. Results failed to indicate a statistically significant difference in academic achievement when the participation in literacy programs was either voluntary or mandatory. These findings support mandatory literacy programs in corrections.]
