However, these simulations have missed the mark when it comes to the fun factor which has affected the uptake and therefore the educational impact of such tools. CONVEX is an educational video game that was developed with the objective of teaching high-level construction management concepts without sacrificing enjoyment. A study was conducted that showed that CONVEX impacted players’ ability to recognize construction activity sequence as well as the resources required to complete these activities. C...
