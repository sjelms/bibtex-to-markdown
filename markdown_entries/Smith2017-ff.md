## Abstract
During the fall of 2014, the National Institute of Building Sciences Off-Site Construction Council conducted a survey in partnership member schools of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture and the Associated Schools of Construction. The online survey was intended to determine the current state of teaching and research on the emerging practice of offsite prefabrication in the design and construction sector. The chapter focuses on the findings of the survey to illuminate the difference between what is being practiced within the construction sector and what is being learned and researched at higher-education institutions. Bridging the gap between education and industry is important in order to create knowledge pathways between what is being researched and taught and what is being practiced. Currently, research agendas on both sides of education and industry are mismatched, with schools focusing on product R\andD and industry needing continuing professional development and training as well as supply chain management support.
