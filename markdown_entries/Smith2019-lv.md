## Abstract
The lack of productivity in the United States (US) construction sector results in part from little product or service innovation that can create value for the industry. This chapter provides a thick description of business innovation typologies relating to the offsite construction industry in the US. Offsite construction is ‘the process of planning, designing, fabricating, transporting, and assembling building elements for rapid site assembly to a greater degree of finish than in traditional piecemeal on-site construction’. Legislatively, however, the process was more clearly regulated and streamlined, occurring primarily offsite, which helps explain why one in every ten housing units constructed each year today in the US are manufactured homes. The US economy presents new opportunities for permanent modular construction to compete. Disruptive, sustaining and radical innovation have all been proffered as potential solutions to answer the construction sector’s stagnation in productivity and demand for growth.
