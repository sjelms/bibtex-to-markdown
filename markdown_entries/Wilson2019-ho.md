## Abstract
Modular construction has often been criticized for limiting architects' creativity in design. However, new approaches are changing this perception by emphasizing early collaboration with fabricators to enable unique designs that meet clients' diverse needs. Modular construction has several advantages, including quality and safety, schedule efficiency, and sustainability, making it an attractive option for owners and project teams. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) Modular and Off-Site Construction Guide serves as a primer for architects to explore the value and opportunities of modular design, potential pitfalls to avoid, and relevant case studies that illustrate successes and obstacles.
