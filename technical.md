## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Obtain the Source Code

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjelms/bibtex-to-markdown.git
cd bibtex-to-markdown
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python package:
```bash
pip install bibtexparser
```

### 3. Configuration

1. Place your BibTeX file in the root directory as `main.bib`
2. Ensure the file uses valid BibTeX formatting
3. Directory Structure:
   - The script will create `markdown_entries/` directory for citation files
   - The script will create `authors/` directory for author files
   - Both directories will be created automatically if they don't exist

### 4. Running the Script

Local execution:
```bash
python convert_bibtex.py
```

#### Targeted updates (editors only)
- Use these flags to update only YAML frontmatter for entries that include editors, preserving any custom content in existing files.
  - `--only-with-editors`: process only entries with an `editor` field
  - `--update-frontmatter-only`: replace only the `--- ... ---` YAML block in existing files
  - `--no-author-files`: skip regenerating per-author MOCs during partial updates

Example (recommended for existing notes in `markdown_entries/`):
```bash
python convert_bibtex.py --only-with-editors --update-frontmatter-only --no-author-files
```

GitHub Actions:
- The script will run automatically when changes are pushed to the repository
- Generated files will be committed back to the repository

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing with sample BibTeX entries
- Validation of output markdown files in Obsidian
- GitHub Actions integration testing

### Sample Data
- Example BibTeX entries are included in `main.bib`
- Sample outputs can be found in `markdown_entries/` directory

### Known Limitations
- Author names must be properly formatted in BibTeX
- Special characters in BibTeX need proper escaping
- Multi-line author entries require careful formatting
- Institution names in author fields need proper bracketing

-----

## ‚ú® Core Logic & Processing Rules

### Stage 1: BibTeX Processing
- File is read using bibtexparser library
- Entries are parsed into dictionary format
- Basic validation of required fields
- Empty fields are handled with default values

### Stage 2: Text Processing
- Special character handling:
  - Escaped characters (`\&`, `\_`) are processed appropriately
  - Formatting is preserved where needed
  - URLs are cleaned of trailing punctuation
- Author name processing:
  - Handles "Last, First" and "First Last" formats
  - Preserves institutional authors in braces
  - Splits multiple authors on " and "
  - Handles multi-line author entries

### Stage 3: Markdown Generation
#### Citation Files:

```markdown
---
title: Paper Title
year: 2023
author - 1: "[[Author Name]]"
editor - 1: "[[Editor Name]]"  # Present only when BibTeX has `editor`
key: "[[@Citation-Key]]"
aliases:
  - Full Title Case
  - Short Title Case
publisher: "[[Publisher]]"
journal: "[[Journal]]"
tags:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
---

> [!bibliography]
> Bibliography formatting in Chicago style

> [!abstract]
> Abstract text
```

**Note:** The bibliography callout format must be consistent as it will be embedded in author files.

#### Editor Support
- Editors are parsed and cleaned using the same logic as authors.
- YAML includes `editor - N: "[[First Last]]"` lines when the BibTeX entry has an `editor` field.
- If an entry has no authors, authors will continue to fall back to editors for author lines (existing behavior).
- Duplicates between authors and editors are allowed and not deduplicated.

#### Partial Update Flags
- `--only-with-editors`: Processes only entries containing `editor`.
- `--update-frontmatter-only`: Updates the YAML block in-place; preserves the note body.
- `--no-author-files`: Skips regenerating per-author files during targeted updates.
  - Useful to avoid truncating author MOCs when doing a subset update.

#### Author Files:

```markdown
---
author: "Author Name"
institution:
field:
type:
aliases:
  - Surname
---

## Author Name
### Content:
[[@Citation-Key|Short Title]]
#### Bibliography:

![[@Citation-Key]]
```

#### Editor Notes
- Editors are treated like authors for note generation to ensure every `[[Name]]` link resolves.
- If a person appears only as an editor, they still get a note under `authors/`.

#### Publisher/Journal Pages
- A page is generated for each unique publisher and journal in `publisher/`.
- Names are normalized by removing punctuation and collapsing spaces (e.g., `John Wiley and Sons, Inc.` ‚Üí `John Wiley and Sons Inc`).
- The normalized name is used both for the wiki-link `[[...]]` in citation YAML and as the filename.
- If the same normalized name appears as both a publisher and a journal, a single page is created with both categories.

Example YAML for a publisher/journal page:

```markdown
---
name: John Wiley and Sons Inc
aliases:
see also:
tags:
category:
  - publisher
---

## John Wiley and Sons Inc

### Content:
[[@Klein2022-xj|Why Housing Is So Expensive ‚Äî Particularly In Blue States]]
[[@Klein2023-qs|The Story Construction Tells About America‚Äôs Economy Is Disturbing]]
[[@Klein2023-sw|The Dystopia We Fear Is Keeping Us From The Utopia We Deserve]]
[[@Klein2025-yx|Abundance]]
```

#### Interdependency:
- Author files use `![[@Citation-Key]]` to embed the bibliography section from citation files
- The `!` in the syntax causes Obsidian to display the actual bibliography content
- Consistent formatting in citation files is crucial as their content is rendered in multiple places
- This creates automatic updates: changes to a citation's bibliography are reflected everywhere it's embedded

  - Enables Obsidian references to author notes using just the last name

- [x] **Add `aliases:` field to citation YAML**
  - Add the **full title** and an optional **short title** (if detected)
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    aliases:
      - A Better Future - Transforming Jobs And Skills For Young People Post-Pandemic
      - A Better Future
    ```

- [x] **Update author files to include a Map of Content (MOC)**
  - In addition to existing `![[@CitationKey]]` transclusions
  - Add Obsidian links with alias syntax:
    ```markdown
    [[@Williams2021-iq|A Better Future]]
    ```
  - This allows the author page to show a human-readable title while linking to the citation note

--- 

This action list defines YAML alias support and enhances author pages with more usable maps of content.
