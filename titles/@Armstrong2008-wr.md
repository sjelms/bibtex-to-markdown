> [!abstract]
> This paper addresses the concept of the readymade—the off-the-shelf industrial artifact—and the development of the kit-built house. It argues that the popularity of prefabrication stems from its economic benefits and the degree of control afforded by factory manufacturing, but its aesthetic expression does not have to be compromised by cost alone. Prefabrication can combine traditional materials with contemporary aesthetics to create innovative solutions and still be affordable. It traces the ready-made from its inception in modernism to today’s kit-built and prefabricated houses.
