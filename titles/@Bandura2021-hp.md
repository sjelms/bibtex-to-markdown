> [!abstract]
> The Classic Edition of this key text highlights seminal work done in the subject of learning by modeling and offers an extensive review of the major theories, edited by one of the most influential psychologists of his generation. In his introductory essay, Bandura identifies the most important controversial issues in the field of observational learning and reviews a large body of research findings, before carefully chosen articles, written by a team of expert contributors, tackle a range of key debates in the field. Topics explored include the role of reinforcement play in observational learning, the scope of modeling influences, the types of people most susceptible to modeling influences, and the relative effectiveness of models presented in live action, in pictorial presentations, or through verbal description. Written in a lively and engaging manner, this book will be of interest to all psychology students interested in psychological modeling, as well as educators and professionals working with children.
