> [!abstract]
> This episode of Bullish with Sonali Basak explores Wall Street’s contested role in the US housing market. Since the 1960s, homeownership costs have risen twice as fast as inflation, while rents have climbed five times faster than wages. Some argue institutional investors have worsened this crisis, while others contend that private equity and public–private partnerships can help address housing shortages. Featuring interviews with Don Mullen (Pretium) and Margaret Anadu (Vistria Group), the program covers topics such as the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis, institutional home ownership, affordable housing initiatives, and the future of private equity in real estate. Hosted by Bloomberg Global Finance Correspondent Sonali Basak.
