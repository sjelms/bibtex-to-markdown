> [!abstract]
> Building on a pledge to support Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) in its Autumn Budget of 2017, the 2019 Conservative party manifesto reaffirmed the target of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s and made explicit commitment to support MMC. The need to accelerate housebuilding is a critical driver for greater adoption of Modern Methods of Construction (MMC). Responding to this need, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) has a programme of work to support MMC, including through its housing funding and land programmes, and to tackle strategic barriers, notably the lack of product standardisation across the industry and the difficulties in obtaining product warranties - and therefore insurance and mortgages.
