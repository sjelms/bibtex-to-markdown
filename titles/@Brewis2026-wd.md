> Students have formed a significant part of London’s population since the foundation of its first university in 1826 and Student London centres their experiences in the city's history. To tell the 200-year story of student life in the capital this book draws on a rich source base that ranges from institutional records to college magazines, court reports to secret service files, and many hundreds of student memoirs and oral histories. It offers a detailed examination of life at the original London University (known as University College London since 1836) alongside many other institutions that eventually joined with UCL. Student London captures a diverse range of higher education experiences across medical schools, teacher training colleges and specialist institutes. A sweeping history of an ever-changing city, the book engages in much greater depth with London’s imperial history than earlier studies of higher education. It examines students’ everyday lives, fees and funding, collegiate cultures, social and political engagement, physical and mental health, recreation, sports and leisure. In doing so, it charts changing student attitudes to class, race, gender, sex and sexuality across two centuries.
