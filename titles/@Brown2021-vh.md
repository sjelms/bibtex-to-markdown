> The core members of our Digital Design team each studied architecture at the Manchester School of Architecture. Throughout the master's training they were inspired to use built environment data alongside prototyped, computational tools to form architectural responses. However, with inkling that computational design could benefit the project, they would dedicate around 80% of their time to typical architecture roles and the remaining 20% to developing computational design techniques. Hawkins\Brown and Architecture 00 collaborated to develop the WikiHouse system into a flexible parametric design tool, where a user could easily alter parameters for a building and watch the 3D model regenerate live. The design system comprised two custom-built computational models, simultaneously controlled using a single spreadsheet of editable design parameters for each structure.
