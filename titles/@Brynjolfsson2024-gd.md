> [!abstract]
> Rapid advances in AI are reshaping how we govern ourselves. Inspired by The Federalist Papers, which promoted the idea of a nation designed by intent rather than by accident, The Digitalist Papers series delves into the critical intersection of AI and democracy. This volume brings together scholars and industry leaders to explore the opportunities and challenges AI presents, offering a range of strategies for a democratic future. Instead of a one-size-fits-all solution, it champions a pluralistic, interdisciplinary approach to navigating this transformative era.
