> The changing landscape of industrial production contains the seeds of a radically different architecture than the one known from previous waves of industrialization. This chapter discusses the concept of montage as a driver for establishing a new perspective on industrially based construction. Montage holds the potential to unleash and introduce dynamics and tension in industrial architecture. The aim of introducing montage is to engender a new industrial conception of architecture. Off-site versus on-site, industry versus craft, system versus individual, speed versus accuracy -  developments in the realm of building construction are frequently explained through dichotomies. Creating architectural dialogues between new and old, industrial and traditional, could provide possible answers to the latent industrial-oriented problems of monotonous repetition, weak architectural significance, neutrality and all-too-smooth surfaces. The inherent differences between industrial and craft-based approaches to building could be regarded as a source of strength and wealth in which one approach accentuates the other.
