> Knowledge is a complex concept, yet the dominant view of knowledge in the management literature is a dichotomy between tacit and explicit. Even the knowledge management literature tends to view knowledge on a limited number of dimensions, whether this is in discussions of knowledge as a commodity or the process of knowing. A review of knowledge from first principles shows that knowledge has different degrees of validity, is highly heterogeneous and has complicated temporal and social aspects. A model of knowledge based on these aspects is presented. Comparing the four dimensions of knowledge with knowledge as a process opens up a more holistic view of knowledge management and helps articulate some of the key differences within streams of research in the field. This holistic perspective is also compatible with Polanyi's original complex conception of tacit knowledge, which drew heavily on Gestalt theory, a theory that examines the perception of "wholes". The dual perspectives of a multi-dimensional conception of knowledge as a commodity and a holistic perspective on knowledge management expands the avenues of potential research and improves our ability to put knowledge in action within organizations.
