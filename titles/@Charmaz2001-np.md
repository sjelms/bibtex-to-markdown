> Novices raise two fundamental questions about qualitative interviewing -  (a) How do you do it? and (b) How do you analyze your interview data? In this chapter, I address how grounded theory methods shape qualitative interviewing in relation to personal narratives and guide analysis of interview data. Essentially, grounded theory methods consist of flexible strategies for focusing and expediting qualitative data collection and analysis. These methods provide a set of inductive steps that successively lead the researcher from studying concrete realities to rendering a conceptual understanding of them. The founders of grounded theory, Barney G. Glaser and Anselm L. Strauss (1967), aimed to develop middle-range theories from qualitative data. Hence they not only intended to conceptualize qualitative data, but planned to demonstrate relations between conceptual categories and to specify the conditions under which theoretical relationships emerge, change, or are maintained.
