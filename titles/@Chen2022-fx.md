> In this paper, we explore how the rise of remote collaboration has shaped the pursuit of new ideas in scientific discovery. To systematically distinguish between disruptive breakthroughs and incremental discoveries, we use citations data for over ten million research teams—publishing in eleven fields of research from 1961 to 2020. On average, we document a robust and significant negative impact of remote collaboration on breakthrough discovery. However, beginning in the 2010s, the negative impact tapers off and even becomes positive. We provide evidence suggesting that the reversal is driven by improvements in key technologies needed for effective remote collaboration.
