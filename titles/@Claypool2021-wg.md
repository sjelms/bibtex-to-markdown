> Increased automation over the last decade has transformed much of the way architects and designers interact, communicate and produce work. Platforms – connecting us through the power of computation and the Internet of Things – and the economic model for automation, have proliferated into our daily lives. Architecture is highly marginalised and 'there is almost no convincing evidence of the value of architects'. For decades, the dominant narrative around automation in construction has centred on the loss of manual labour jobs. Architects can either contribute to changing notions of the role and value of design or succumb to greater irrelevance. A new generation of digital architects and designers have confronted the contradiction by radically rethinking the parts that make up buildings utilising the concept of the Discrete. Each project uses only a single sheet of plywood to form one block, sitting in direct contrast to earlier ‘digital' work where variation in size of parts results in significant material waste.
