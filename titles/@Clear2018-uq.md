> [!abstract]
> James Clear reveals exactly how minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of habit stacking, the unexpected power of the two-minute rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.
