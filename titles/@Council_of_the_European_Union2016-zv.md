> Basic skills—literacy, numeracy, and digital competence—constitute the essential foundation for meaningful participation in contemporary society and the labor market. Despite their importance, a substantial proportion of adults in the European Union lack functional proficiency in these domains. Approximately one quarter of adult Europeans experience difficulties with reading and writing, basic calculation, and the effective use of digital tools in everyday contexts. In addition, around 21 percent of adults have attained no more than lower secondary education. Deficits in foundational skills and low qualification levels are strongly associated with increased risks of unemployment, poverty, and social exclusion. In response to these structural challenges, the Council adopted the Recommendation on Upskilling Pathways in 2016, establishing a coordinated framework to support adults in acquiring minimum levels of literacy, numeracy, and digital competence and to enhance their prospects for sustainable employment and social inclusion.
