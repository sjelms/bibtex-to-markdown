> Skilled labor is vital to the success of any construction project, and no contractor would be able to operate without the skilled laborers that they employ. The construction industry has been subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last two decades for many reasons, including the poor image of construction workers among the public, inadequate training measures, and an aging workforce. Reviewing the literature on the matter shows that the leading cause of shortage is low pay and increasing age of the workforce overall, while the demand for labor grows at a faster rate than the supply of labor grows. Poor worker retention practices were also identified as a cause for shortage and a reason for workers leaving the industry, and proper retention tactics are assessed, including monetary and non-monetary considerations for workers in order to foster a better employer-employee relationship. Recruiting practices among labor unions and contractors are also assessed through interviews and research, with the results suggesting that a greater emphasis should be put on improving the image of construction workers in the public eye, increasing the prestige of a job in construction and leading to increased participation in the construction industry among young people.
