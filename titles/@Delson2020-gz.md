> It has increasingly been recognized that spatial visualization skills are important in supporting student success in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education and retention of these students in STEM careers. While many first-year college engineering programs and high schools with pre-engineering curriculum have incorporated spatial visualization training into their courses, there is no reason why spatial visualization training could not start at elementary school. At the older age groups, the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test -  Rotations (PSVT - R), which is recognized as a gold standard assessment tool, is used to measure students’ learning gains in their spatial skills. However, it not suitable for elementary school grades. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego developed an assembly pre- and post- test based upon a timed Lego™ exercise which would lend itself well to K-12 students.
