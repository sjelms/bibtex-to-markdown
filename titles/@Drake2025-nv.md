> [!abstract]
> Many scientists, at every career stage, struggle to begin writing scientific papers. This is often not a matter of procrastination or a lack of ideas, but of knowing how to start -  what kind of sentence belongs at the beginning of a paragraph, what kind of paragraph belongs at the beginning of a section, and what kind of story emerges from a collection of results. These are fundamentals of writing, but they are often difficult to implement in scientific writing, where the ideas can be complex and the structure less intuitive. In our experience mentoring graduate students and postdocs, we’ve seen that drafts often lack topic sentences, transitions, or a clear rationale—not because the writer lacks good ideas, but because those ideas are not yet scaffolded into a structure that connects them.
