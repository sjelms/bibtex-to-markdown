> [!abstract]
> Motivationally intelligent systems deploy resources and tactics dynamically to maintain or increase the student’s desire to learn and her willingness to expend effort in so doing. Three categories of diagnostic inputs and feedback reactions are outlined each with its associated meta-level. The meta-level includes the account which learners tell themselves, the system and others about what they know, how they feel, and the conditions under which they learn best.
