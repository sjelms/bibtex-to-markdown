> The effective management of modern complex construction projects requires a clear understanding of how the stages and players involved interrelate. From the inception of the project onwards, information is generated which is then required to be adapted and communicated through the various stages to the individuals involved so as to complete the project. Of these stages, the design has always been recognised as important but, in project management terms, not easily managed. The activities involved in designing are complex and there is a need to employ the services of an increasing number of specialists. This research uses the framework developed in Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to establish the existing process involved in developing and managing the design. An important element of the building, the façade, is used as an example of what happens more generally and the research is based on an in-depth case study approach of four UK construction projects. To deal with the quantity and quality of the qualitative data, the methodology of cognitive mapping is used to first create, and then analyse, the perceptions of key decision makers involved in the creation and management of the design. Using computer based analytical tools the data is filtered through a number of stages to produce summaries of the process of design. The results of the research identify the need for the communication of the key project objectives, together with the formation of a strategy for achieving these objectives, at the outset. Selection of the right individuals, at the right time will significantly increase the development of the team approach, which is necessary to successfully develop the design. Finally, the use of formalised reviews can ensure that design progresses so as to meet the project objectives.
