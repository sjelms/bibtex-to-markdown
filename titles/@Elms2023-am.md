> The construction industry is essential to the global economy yet faces persistent challenges including low productivity, limited technological adoption, and a critical shortage of skilled labor. As the sector embraces offsite construction and digitalization, new skills and training models are required. Traditional vocational education pathways have not evolved to meet these needs. This research investigates how workers in industrialized and offsite construction environments acquire and apply new competencies through workplace learning, aiming to bridge the gap between vocational education and the rapidly changing demands of the modern construction industry.
