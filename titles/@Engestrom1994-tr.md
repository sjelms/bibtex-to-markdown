> [!abstract]
> Neither traditional book learning nor the acquisition of fixed routines by practice and imitation are adequate for coping with rapidly changing work activities. Work-related training of adults faces the challenge of raising the quality of learning. This book offers a framework for eliciting and supporting poductive learning through instruction. Training for change presents a cognitive and activity-theoretical view of learning and teaching. The book gives concrete guidelines and practical examples for the formulation of cognitive objectives of instruction, for the organization of learning contents, for the selection of instructional methods, and for the planning of curricula. It is useful for everyone interested in turning workplaces into learning organizations. Yrjö Engeström is Professor of Communication and Director of the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition at the Universty of California, San Diego.
