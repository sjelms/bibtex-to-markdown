> [!abstract]
> With the first-ever European Affordable Housing Plan presented today, the Commission addresses one of the most pressing needs of European citizens: access to affordable, sustainable and good-quality housing. With an average increase of house prices by more than 60%, and of rents by more than 20% in the past ten years, millions of Europeans are struggling to find a home they can afford. By hurting labour mobility, access to education, and family formation, the housing crisis is hampering both the competitiveness of the EU economy and social cohesion. Tackling this crisis requires a truly European effort anchored in local realities.
