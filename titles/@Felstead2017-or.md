> [!abstract]
> This chapter critically appraises the different types of international and national skills data currently available in terms of the underlying concepts of skill and the collection techniques used. It focuses on three ways of measuring skills using surveys. The first measures the skills held by a given group of individuals – the skills stock. The second focuses on the skills required to do the job competently – job skills, and the third uncovers mismatches between skills supply and skills demand. In doing so, the chapter reviews the strengths and weaknesses of the survey tools and concepts which have been developed, and pieces together some of main findings which have emerged. The chapter therefore equips readers with the necessary tools to navigate their own way through the myriad of datasets available and the measures they use.
