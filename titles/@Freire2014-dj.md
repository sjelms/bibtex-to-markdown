> [!abstract]
> In his earliest work, Freire critiques the banking model of education, whereby the educator deposits information in the learners’ minds under the assumption that there is nothing to learn from the learners themselves. This model resonates with education under colonialism and neoliberalism, where some types of knowledge are deemed more valid than others. In Pedagogy of Hope, Freire invites us to overcome this model through hope, in a non-idealistic but ontological manner, acting in the world to transform oppressive conditions, expanding possibilities for social justice.
