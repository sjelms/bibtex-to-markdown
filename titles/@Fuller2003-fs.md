> This report presents the findings from a study of the impact of informal learning at work on business productivity, funded by the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI). The study was carried out between October 2002 and September 2003. The aims of the study were to -  a) review existing literature and survey data on informal learning in the workplace; b) propose ways in which the links between informal learning in the workplace, product market strategies and business performance might be tested in a survey; c) provide an analysis of best practice; d) propose ways to target case study material at a business audience in order to illustrate the range of practice of informal learning and the impact of such learning on business performance.
