> [!abstract]
> On Critical Pedagogy, Henry Giroux argues that education is inherently political and should be a site for social change, not just a reflection of existing power structures. The summary of his work highlights the need to develop students' critical consciousness through dialogue, to challenge inequalities, and to move beyond merely being passive recipients of knowledge. His approach encourages students to become critically engaged agents who can question authority and work toward a more democratic and just society.
