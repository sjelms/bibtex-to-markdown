> [!abstract]
> Giroux’s Pedagogy of Resistance: Against Manufactured Ignorance (2022) offers a compelling argument about the growing threat of fascism under neoliberal capitalist regimes, building on his lifetime’s work as an educator, theorist and activist. He offers a detailed analysis of how the current economic, political and social climate of neoliberalism has been exacerbated by the political regime of Trump’s presidency and the continued rise of gangster capitalism. The book focuses primarily on the context and events in North America but has widespread relevance due to the global impact of capitalism.
