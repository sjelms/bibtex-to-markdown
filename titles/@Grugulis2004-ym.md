> [!abstract]
> The book is an edited collection of academic papers from leading academics across the UK, Europe, the USA, and Australia. It provides a critical analysis of skills acquisition, formation, and development, combining academic evidence with policy debates. It is intended for students of Human Resource Management (HRM), industrial relations, sociology of work, and business/management, as well as researchers and policymakers in the field. The various chapters explore topics such as the definition of skill, emotion work as skilled work, the interdependence of social and technical skills, and the political economy of skill.
