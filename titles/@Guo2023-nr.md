> Traditional behaviour-based safety (BBS) suffers several major limitations, which have impeded its successful implementation. Construction 4.0 technologies bring significant opportunities that can rejuvenate BBS. However, digital technology–based BBS is still in its infancy. This chapter aims to bridge digital technologies and behaviour-change mechanisms by proposing a sensor-based BBS framework. The conceptual framework consists of four layers: (1) data collection, (2) safety behaviour recognition, (3) interventions, and (4) behaviour-change mechanism. The framework specifies the synergy between traditional and modern BBS and sensor technologies and how the synergy can address the common pitfalls of traditional BBS. A case study of vision-based lifted load detection was reported to demonstrate some of the key components of the conceptual framework. The framework represents a significant effort to integrate digital technologies into conceptual aspects of BBS. The conceptual framework provides a road map for future BBS research directions and practices in the digital age. Future research directions were proposed.
