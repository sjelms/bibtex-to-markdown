> This paper presents the development a spatial ability test application in virtual reality and establishes a measurement plan for technical and other, user-related parameters. The application can measure these parameters in three different types of tests -  The Mental Cutting Test, the Mental Rotation Test, and the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test. The goal of this application is to increase the spatial ability of the users with the mentioned tests, while also logging the two types of parameters and determining whether there is a correlation between them and test completion times.
