> Operation Breakthrough was a 3-phase HUD demonstration that tested innovative building materials and methods. Operating from May 1969 to the mid-1970s, Operation Breakthrough was designed to identify and demonstrate solutions to obstacles preventing large-scale housing production in the nation, with the goal of volume production of quality housing for all income groups. The demonstration sought housing system improvements, while at the same time providing improved environmental quality and low-cost maintenance.
