> [!abstract]
> Rapid developments in Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality (AR) are opening the possibilities for a closer relationship between humans, computers and machines, requiring multiple fields and industries to rethink the role of humans in the production chain. This chapter presents several research projects as case studies to discuss the issue and pose further questions on how architects should respond. With the commercialisation of various devices, Virtual Reality and AR are becoming increasingly popular topics in numerous industries, including design and architecture. The structure is a prototype for an adaptive design and fabrication system, resilient to wide tolerances in material behaviour and fabrication accuracy while being the largest structure to date built on the principles of AR-assisted fabrication. The design is inspired by a traditional Métis sash, which is made with the art of finger weaving, and draped across one's shoulder or tied around one's waist. The aim is to develop an adaptable workflow and toolset, applicable to various design-to-fabrication scenarios.
