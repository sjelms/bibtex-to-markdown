> [!abstract]
> The work conducted on innovative systems aimed at increasing the level of offsite construction and improving the overall building performance, while minimising economic cost and thus ensuring social accessibility. Across the UK, the construction industry is characterised by several regional differences, including the level of uptake of offsite production. If Scottish wood is produced through good silvicultural practices and is properly utilised in the construction sector, the import of raw material from other countries can be drastically reduced, with several advantages. In Scotland, innovation in the construction sector is often driven by large companies that can invest a quota of their turnover in research and development to create new products, experiment with new materials or develop more efficient methods of erection. The most significant drivers for offsite construction are considered by the Scottish respondents to be government policies, the housing shortage and environmental credentials, whereas less importance is attached to advanced systems and production methods.
