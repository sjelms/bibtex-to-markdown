> [!abstract]
> Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari offers a sweeping, interdisciplinary account of human history, tracing Homo sapiens from insignificant apes to rulers of the world by focusing on three major revolutions—Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific—and exploring how our unique ability to believe in shared fictions (like money, nations, and gods) allowed for large-scale cooperation, shaping our cultures, societies, and future, while questioning the true meaning of "progress" and our impact on the planet.
