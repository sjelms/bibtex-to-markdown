> Summary This chapter discusses the challenge of increasing the responsivity of vocational education. Responsivity is defined as the ability of vocational education and training (VET) to interpret socioeconomic and technological developments for curriculum design in terms of content and pedagogical approach. VET needs to equip young people with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to engage in work and make a difference in the transformation of work. This chapter argues that learners have to be provided with opportunities to actively engage in innovation at work to experience what is needed to deal with uncertainty and to organize their own learning in such circumstances. In the Netherlands, the challenges of building regional networks and participating in regional innovation are being taken up by higher professional education (HPE). This chapter describes the promising approach developed in the Netherlands, which focuses on innovative work-based learning to strengthen responsivity.
