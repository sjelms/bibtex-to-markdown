> Safety hazard identification is a crucial process in safety management. However, it relies heavily on subjective judgement and experience. There exist some specific applications of machine learning techniques to automate the process based on learning from previous accidents. What is currently lacking is a systematic review of machine learning applications on safety hazard identification. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the current applications of machine learning on safety hazard identification, highlighting its merits and drawbacks, and discussing the implications for industry practice and further research. The horizon scan shows that text mining, image recognition and their integration with other technologies are currently the three dominant areas of machine learning applications on safety hazard identification. This research field is huge and has a huge potential to tap in the future to upscale the utilization of machine learning for hazard identification in the Construction Industry 4.0 environment.
