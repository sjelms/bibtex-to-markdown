> In Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom (1994), bell hooks argues for a holistic, "engaged pedagogy" that challenges traditional, hierarchical "banking" models of education. Drawing on Paulo Freire's work, she presents education as a practice of freedom and a tool for liberation from systems of oppression such as racism, sexism, and classism.
