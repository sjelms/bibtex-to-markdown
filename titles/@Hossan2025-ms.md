> The utilisation of theory, the conceptual framework, the theoretical framework, and the research framework is frequently required to be clearly articulated in academic studies. However, these terms are often used interchangeably without a clear understanding of their distinctions. This scenario is complicated because the terms theoretical, conceptual, and research frameworks are employed differently in different research approaches. This article aims to define these concepts and explain their usage with two research approaches: the objectivist deductive approach, which goes from theory to data, and the subjectivist inductive approach, which goes from data to theory, together with a research framework. The theoretical framework provides the foundation of established theories and principles underpinning the study, offering a broad lens through which the research phenomenon is understood. The conceptual framework, derived from the theoretical framework, refines the understanding by delineating specific constructs and their interrelationships, serving as a guide to address the research objectives. Meanwhile, the research framework translates these constructs into operationalised variables and methodologies, facilitating the systematic collection and analysis of data. Together, these frameworks ensure the study's alignment with established knowledge while enabling methodological rigour and clarity in addressing the research problem. Furthermore, the integration of research, conceptual, and theoretical frameworks not only guides the logical flow of a study and strengthens its academic foundation but also enhances its potential to generate meaningful insights across diverse domains, including business innovation and strategy, international business and marketing, technology and operations management, corporate governance and ethics, human resource and project management, and entrepreneurship.
