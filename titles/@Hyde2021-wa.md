> Odico Construction Robotics was founded on the belief that the broader imperative to enhance the built environment's sustainability holds a positive driver towards enriching the quality of architectural design. One key component of the notion is the widening theoretical body documenting an inverse proportionality between formal complexity and the consumption of construction material. This chapter outlines the principal journey of Odico by describing the first technological innovations and current developments, and concludes by projecting forward with new fabrication innovations. While the founding history of Odico has been closely linked with wire-cutting of Expanded Polystyrene formwork, the Factory on the Fly constitutes a general-purpose, process-agnostic, cyber-physical platform technology based on a modular architecture, which can facilitate a plurality of machining processes. In timber construction, workers often need to process timber at both ends, which in robotic terms would require either a large robot or an extra axis of freedom.
