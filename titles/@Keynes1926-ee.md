> [!abstract]
> "The End of Laissez-Faire" is the title of a seminal 1926 work by English economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) that argues against the doctrine of unregulated free markets, advocating instead for government intervention to manage a modern economy and ensure stability. Keynes believed the role of the state should be determined case-by-case, rather than by a general rule, and challenged the notion that the market alone could solve problems like unemployment. This work, based on lectures from 1924 and 1926, is a fundamental text that presciently questioned laissez-faire policies and continues to influence debates about the state's role in the economy.
