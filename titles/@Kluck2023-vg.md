> Modularization A practical, hands-on guide to offsite preassembly, beginning with the project as just a concept gleam in the CEO’s eye and winding all the way through implementation at the construction site. Modularization is a philosophy change! And along with that change, comes the need to understand the implementation requirements and project mindset adjustments that impact and influence all aspects of the modular project. To accomplish this, the book provides a complete (from beginning to end) identification and evaluation of the differences that make a modular project unique, starting with the very basics in terms of definitions and setting the groundwork of expectations by identifying benefits and challenges. Then, because the journey is as important as the destination, the reader is guided through the various project phases in a manner that reflects how they would be addressed in the workplace. From the very earliest identification of concepts, through early assessment and selection of the optimal choice to be finally carried into detailed design, the reader is acquainted with each phase of the development process, including explanations and relevant suggestions for many of the questions and issues that typically come up. A perfect reference for professional and technical leaders when developing the early, critical planning phases of modular projects, this guide offers useful examples and details on the fundamentals required to get a modular project started correctly and keep it on track.
