> Workplace learning often requires workers to learn new perceptual and motor skills. The future of work will increasingly feature human users who cooperate with machines, both to learn the tasks and to perform them. In this paper, we examine workplace learning in Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), i.e., recycling plants, where workers separate waste items on conveyer belts before they are formed into bales and reprocessed. Using a simulated MRF, we explored the benefit of machine learning assistants (MLAs) that help workers, and help train them, to sort objects efficiently by providing automated perceptual guidance. In a randomized experiment (n = 140), we found -  (1) A low-accuracy MLA is worse than no MLA at all, both in terms of task performance and learning. (2) A perfect MLA led to the best task performance, but was no better in helping users to learn than having no MLA at all. (3) Users tend to follow the MLA’s judgments too often, even when they were incorrect. Finally, (4) we devised a novel learning analytics algorithm to assess the worker’s accuracy, with the goal of obtaining additional training labels that can be used for fine-tuning the machine. A simulation study illustrates how even noisy labels can increase the machine’s accuracy.
