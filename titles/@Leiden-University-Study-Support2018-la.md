> The symptoms of ADHD and ADD include issues with organisation or maintaining concentration and hyperfocus. This means that studying with ADHD and ADD may require additional time and effort. Writing a thesis is a lot of work. The more structured you are, the better. Unfortunately, if you have AD(H)D that can be quite a challenge. However, by taking a phased approach to the thesis process, you can avoid a lot of difficulties.
