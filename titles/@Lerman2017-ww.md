> Concerns about the polarization of the labor market are widespread. However, countries vary widely in strategies for strengthening jobs at intermediate levels of skill. This paper examines the role of apprenticeship in training and upgrading for middle-level occupations. The first section defines and describes middle-skills occupations, largely in terms of education and experience. The next step is to examine skill requirements and alternative approaches to preparing and upgrading the skills of individuals for these occupations. Programs of academic education and apprenticeship programs emphasizing work-based learning have often competed for the same space but with significant complementarities. Third, we consider the evidence on the costs and effectiveness of apprenticeship training in several countries from the employer, worker, and government perspectives. The final section highlights the advantages of apprenticeship training for intermediate level skills, jobs, and careers.
