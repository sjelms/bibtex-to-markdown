> [!abstract]
> Sweden remained neutral in both wars, leaving the industrial infrastructure intact, and directly after the end of World War II, the first national building code was issued. Between 1965 and 1975, Sweden produced a million dwellings as a result of a political initiative, bringing to an end the 50-year-long housing shortage. In 1994, the government removed all subsidiaries to housing construction in Sweden and for the first time in 70 years, the housing market was governed by market forces only. The development of offsite construction was technology driven in Sweden up until 1970. When venturing into offsite construction, there are investments. These investments are commonly in production equipment and even factories, but also in personnel, training, and the supply chain. The lean operations strategy was originally developed to enable the production of high-quality goods with a small amount of resources in a short amount of time.
