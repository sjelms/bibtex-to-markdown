> This introductory book covers the entire construction industry as a whole — with specific details, information, and directions — as well as the impact and basic inner working of the industry in each project. It addresses three specific industry aspects -  the “players” the “processes,” and “practices” — all spelled out in a way that promotes readers' understanding. An effective overview of the basic essence of construction, its impact on society, and the magnificent work it produces, helps demonstrates the worldwide impact of the industry. Chapter topics include The construction industry at large, the “players” in construction, the sequence of a project, and communications and documentation. Appendices cover -  a narrative of a project sequence; the concept and application of building codes and other construction regulations; sample specification (on regulations); a project checklist; costing; trade associations, standards-generating organizations, governing authorities; and leading firms in the industry. For those involved in architecture and the various engineering disciplines connected with project design and construction — as well as in related businesses — who need help understanding the construction process.
