> Technological advancement has led to the increased reliance on machines in place of human construction workers. Advanced robotics and automation systems are therefore becoming commonplace on construction sites albeit used mostly alongside construction workers, since many trades still require human skills. As a result of these hybrid robot–human industrial scenarios, the EU commission of Safety and Health has forecast that the greatest occupational safety risks over the coming years will emanate from the interactions between humans and machines in most industrial sectors. Despite the potential efficiency gains from the use of robots or robotic devices in construction, the emergent risks need to be identified, understood, and mitigated through various interventions including risk assessment and worker training. The main aim of this chapter is therefore to identify and list the health and safety risks associated with construction robot use. The study adopts an expert desk research and workshops following focus group methodological approach. Based on the systematic analysis of data and expert opinion, 59 risk factors were identified together with the potential sources of each risk. The most prevalent risks source was identified as the work environment (work design failure and procedural failures). The study further highlights the dominance of physical risks but highlights the emergence of psychosocial risks associated with the use of all types of construction robots. The findings focus primarily on the prevalence or likely existence of the risks factors. Thus, further studies need to be conducted to establish their impact or importance in practice. The list of risk factors provides comprehensive guidance for the development of safety training and guidance material for risk assessment in this emergent risk area.
