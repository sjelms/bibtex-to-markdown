> [!abstract]
> At the end of 2017, following a specific commitment made in the 2017 housing white paper Fixing our broken housing market, the UK government launched a cross industry working group. The group was tasked with supporting the mortgage finance, insurance and valuation communities in better understanding and supporting the greater use of Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) across residential development. That working group has been developing various outputs, one of which is a new categorised definition framework for different forms of innovative construction methodologies. This framework was established by a specialist sub-group led by Mark Farmer of Cast Consultancy, the chair of the wider MMC working group, supported by representatives of Buildoffsite, Homes England, National Home Building Council (NHBC) and Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).
