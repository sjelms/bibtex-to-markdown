> [!abstract]
> This innovative Handbook aims to look at the logic, various dimensions, and implications of collaboration in construction. It opens with a conceptualization of collaboration and its accompanying terms (i.e., cooperation and coordination) and continues with chapters in Part I which discuss the theoretical grounds of collaboration between individuals and organizations from the viewpoints of an impressive variety of relevant disciplines including organizational science; anthropology; law; economics; design; and production.This is followed by discussions of the essence and value of collaboration in construction in Part II through explaining the role of collaborative project delivery methods and their benefits in advancing collaboration, describing the competency profile of project managers for collaborative construction, explaining key drivers and barriers of collaboration in construction, and explaining practices as well as challenges of measuring collaboration in construction.Then, in Part III, case projects are employed to explain the benefits of collaboration in different levels of team, project, and business, to discuss the role and impact of collaboration on site and bridging the divide between construction and facility management, to discuss the role of digitalization in facilitating and advancing collaboration, to explain collaboration in decision making, to present examples of collaborative visual management, and to outline the implications of stakeholders' early involvement and collaboration for project success. Finally, consideration is given to the future of collaboration in construction to conclude the book.This Handbook is key reading for a broad ranging audience within the fields of construction, project, infrastructure and engineering management, organisational science, economics, and business management.
