> [!abstract]
> This infographic illustrates how forests of different ages play different roles in removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in wood. Managing forests to avoid large emissions from the loss of old trees while rapidly removing CO2 from the atmosphere through young forest growth can provide both storage and sequestration benefits. The infographic also speaks to the role that harvested wood products play. The data contained in the infographic are sourced from an array of peer-reviewed publications.
