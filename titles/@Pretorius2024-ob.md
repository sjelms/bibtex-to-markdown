> A sound understanding of research paradigms is crucial for developing coherent and philosophically grounded research designs, particularly in the humanities and social sciences. This paper offers an accessible overview of the most common research paradigms: positivism, post-positivism, constructivism, social constructionism, interpretivism, pragmatism, and critical realism. These paradigms differ in their approaches to ontology (the nature of reality), epistemology (the nature of knowledge), and axiology (the role of values in research). The paper also discusses the methodological and ethical implications of these paradigms. Reflexivity and ethical responsibility are emphasised, where researchers must account for how their own biases and values influence their work. By exploring these paradigms and their philosophical foundations, this paper aims to help researchers identify the paradigm that best aligns with their views about the world, ultimately enabling them to coherently design studies that are methodologically sound, ethically informed, and practically relevant. This article contributes to academic discourse by offering a clear and practical guide to research paradigms, fostering a deeper understanding of the philosophical underpinnings that shape research practices across disciplines.
