> This paper traces the origins of the scaffolding construct, placing it in its theoretical-historical context. The paper discusses the connection between Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), and the notion of scaffolding, and explicates the differences between scaffolding and scaffolds. The paper then presents a discussion of the changes that the notion of scaffolding has undergone, especially when it comes to supporting students in classroom contexts. In classrooms where one teacher supports multiple students, scaffolding is distributed across various tools and social scaffolds. A discussion of the notion of distributed scaffolding is presented, to describe how students in classrooms may be supported by various tools and social scaffolds. The paper then introduces the kinds of distribution and interactions between tools and social scaffolds that need to be considered to support multiple students in classroom contexts. Finally, distributed scaffolding is discussed with reference to the key features of scaffolding, especially fading and transfer of responsibility.
