> The strategies and technologies of industrialization have demonstrated a capacity to offer to the vast majority of people, at an affordable price, almost all the products available on the market. The main parts of a building system are its sub-systems, which correspond to the main functions of the building. A building system is usually composed of five major sub-systems -  structure, envelope, partitions, services and equipment. The site-intensive kit-of-parts involves a few simple components produced in large quantity at specialized plants and delivered separately to the site, thereby implying a series of jointing operations once at the site. Cross-laminated timber panels are now up to eight stories high, but higher levels are presently being built; they can meet both the required soundproofing and fireproofing levels on their own whenever the proper number of plies is supplied.
