> Summary form only given, as follows. Dr. Jaime R. Carbonell, who was a member of the Administrative Committee of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society, died suddenly on February 2, 1973, at age 44 from cardiac arrest. Dr. Carbonell was Manager of the Artificial Intelligence Department at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., and an Associate Editor of the SMC TRANSACTIONS. At BBN he had conducted studies in the development of models of time-sharing systems, pilot-behavior in instrument flying, and man-computer interaction. Recently, he had done pioneering work in the application of artificial intelligence techniques to man-computer interaction. In this work, he developed the SCHOLAR system, a computeraided instruction system which both asks and answers questions in dialogue with a student. In addition to his own contribution to mixed-initiative systems in education, he had a forceful and inspiring influence on his colleagues.
