> [!abstract]
> Effective and systematic training is an essential solution that could overcome the issues of high accident rates and facilitate safe construction practices. Majority of current practices and systems lack interactive learning capabilities which restricts a dynamic learning experience. Tertiary construction education has previously employed smart technologies enabled learning platforms to facilitate construction risk and safety education. However, a gap exists in improving risk and safety education and learning aspects within building construction. With the introduction of Industry 4.0, there is a growing need to improve immersive learning experiences to facilitate effective learning in construction risk and safety. The study presents key components related to teaching strategy, learning content and assessment criteria or a virtual reality (VR) –enabled learning platform to facilitate construction risk and safety education. Key component further suggest that increasing interaction and feedback of the learning tasks and improving he authenticity of the assessment could significantly improve the efficiency of the learning process related to construction risk and safety. Further research is necessary to investigate user experience involving active users of the developed system to authenticate the functionality of the system using pre and post usage experience.
