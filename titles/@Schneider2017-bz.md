> In this chapter, I explore how new learning environments, such as mixed reality interfaces (i.e., interfaces that combine physical and virtual information), can prepare students for future learning. I describe four controlled experiments that I have conducted over the years where students learned complex concepts in STEM and where a Tangible User Interface created a “Time for Telling”. This is followed by a summary the findings, a discussion of the possible mechanisms for the effect found in those studies, and a suggestion of design guidelines for creating this type of constructivist activities. I conclude by discussing the potential of mixed reality interfaces for preparing students for future learning.
