> [!abstract]
> Among the possible applications of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the construction industry is gamification used as a teaching and training strategy. Educational or serious games can improve professional practice with current pedagogical techniques, including occupational health and safety (OHS). Also aware of this need, several applications were designed by software development companies, focusing on OHS on construction sites. One of the steps in developing computer programs is evaluating the software quality. Software quality requirements can be analyzed through systematized assessment models. This chapter analyzes a free game related to OHS training using mobile learning application–based software quality evaluation model. It used the Mobile Learning Evaluation Method (MoLEva) to identify the educational, social, and technical aspects related to the effective use of the informatics applications. The results showed that an assessment method is essential for developing and continuous improvement of applications to meet the necessary learning requirements. This chapter presents a decision support procedure for evaluating mobile education games to train construction workers in OHS. Correct app identification will depend on understanding the training needs in adopting Industry 4.0 strategies in Construction 4.0.
