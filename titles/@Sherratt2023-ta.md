> [!abstract]
> Construction 4.0 brings new ‘colleagues’ to sites in the form of drones, robots and autonomous plant, but for workers themselves, digitization often takes the form of wearable technologies, integrated into hard hats or clothing. In this chapter, we critically reflect on the implications of these new technologies for the future experience of construction site work. We argue that although better management of worker health and safety is the often-stated rationale for the deployment of these technologies, for example alerting workers of nearby hazards, they can also, potentially, be used to place workers under detailed and unwelcome managerial surveillance. Wearables can be used to track precise individual locations and movements on site or collect data on emotional responses and other personal health information. But it is well established that constant surveillance is bad for human well-being, creating stress and anxiety from losses of autonomy and privacy. When aligned to technological expectations of productivity, from data ostensibly generated for AI-enhanced site management, job security also becomes vulnerable. Here, we explore the consequences of wearables for worker well-being, both in the current state of the art and with an eye to future developments.
