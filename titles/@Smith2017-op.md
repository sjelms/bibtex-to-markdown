> Permanent modular construction (PMC) has been marketed as a more cost-effective, higher-quality, and faster-to-market solution than traditional stick-built construction. The added value of PMC, although conceptually strong, has yet to be significantly substantiated. The study quantifies the added value of PMC and evaluates the contextual factors by which PMC in building design and construction may be realized in North America and beyond. The data from the PMC projects was compared to benchmark projects developed by Cumming Corporation, a cost consultancy firm. It is important to note that most stakeholders reported PMC offers a greater control of cost compared to traditional build. This is attributed to the inherent ability to reduce the number of change orders in any given PMC project. The most significant benefit of PMC is its ability to be completed with reduction in schedule. Every survey respondent named meeting the substantial completion deadline as a success.
