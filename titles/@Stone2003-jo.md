> An exploration of how regional definitions of Appalachia vary geographically and culturally, discussing mapping efforts, sub-regions, and the social and economic factors that shape Appalachian identity. The article examines how the Appalachian region is defined and challenges the official boundaries set by the Appalachian Regional Commission. It argues that Appalachia is too geographically and culturally diverse to be treated as a single, uniform region. Using county-level mapping tools, the author experiments with alternative definitions and introduces sub-regions—such as the Great Valley Country, Holler Land, and Pittsburghia—to capture internal variations in terrain, economy, and identity. The discussion highlights how geography, economic ties, and local culture intersect to produce multiple overlapping “Appalachias,” suggesting that the region should be understood as a set of related but distinct places rather than one continuous whole.
