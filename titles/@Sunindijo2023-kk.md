> [!abstract]
> Although touted as a disruptive Industry 4.0 innovation, the use of prefabrication in the Australian construction industry is still relatively limited. To promote its wider use, research and industry efforts have been exerted to demonstrate the benefits of prefabrication in the construction sector. Building on these efforts, this chapter focuses on demonstrating the impact of prefabrication on health and safety in Australian housing projects, a context that has not been much investigated in prefabrication research before. Data, including project duration, labour hours, manual handling, and coordination activities, were collected from two case study projects. Prefabricated wall and floor panels were used in the first project, while the second case used prefabricated bathroom pods. Both case studies demonstrate that prefabrication can deliver short and long-term health and safety benefits. In short-term cases, prefabrication can reduce workers and community’s exposure to health and safety risks due to shorter time spent on site and fewer labour hours. In the long term, it reduces manual handling, which can then reduce the occurrence of long-term health impact of manual-handling activities, such as musculoskeletal disorders. Prefabrication also requires less on-site management and coordination, which can reduce work stressors and improve the mental health of construction personnel. However, prefabrication also changes the risk profile of construction activities and, as a result, can bring new risks which are different from those found in a conventional construction approach. Investigating its health and safety risks across the life cycle of prefabrication processes, including manufacturing, transportation, and installation, is needed to understand the health and safety impact of prefabrication. This research is significant, as it provides industry-based evidence on the short- and long-term health and safety benefits of prefabrication in the Australian housing sector.
