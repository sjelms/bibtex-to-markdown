> [!abstract]
> According to the UNESCO’s general principles, technical vocational education and training (TVET) is part of both the universal right to education and the right to work. In this respect, TVET is understood as contributing toward the promotion of understanding and respect for human rights; inclusion and social equity; gender equality and cultural diversity. Furthermore, TVET plays a role in fostering lifelong learning and a sense of community thus contributing to social and economic participation and to the realization of lasting peace, responsible citizenship, and sustainable development.
