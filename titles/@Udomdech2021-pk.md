> Built environment organisations innovate or adopt innovation to address complexity and uncertainty that emerge in project operations. Amongst various built environment innovations, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is prominently chosen by the built environment organisations. This innovation presents a great challenge for Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). It renders existing working paradigms obsolete and digitally transforms built environment businesses. The lack of individuals with adequate BIM competence is a major problem. Project-Based Learning (PBL) is a potential solution. This research aims to investigate BIM learning in projects in the built environment SMEs. The study examines knowledge practices used in projects and how they are exercised together in forming a project-based learning mechanism of BIM. 31 designers and engineers from the British and the Thai design and engineering SME consultancies are interviewed. Knowledge practices are identified based on their significance, while associations between them are analysed. Informal meeting, Knowledge team creation, and Standardisation play a crucial role in BIM learning in projects. Informal meeting and Knowledge team creation relate to tacit knowledge learning and exploration. Standardisation encourages explicit knowledge learning and exploitation. A project-based learning mechanism of BIM is formed through an interconnected system of knowledge practices. The connections among knowledge practices are found as assistive and correlative. The project-based learning mechanisms of BIM identified within this research are ambidextrous through the variety of knowledge practices being exercised together. Additionally, they can be further categorised as Exploitative, Ambidextrous, and Explorative. Practical suggestions are provided for BIM managers to increase attention towards the employment of certain knowledge practices and the creation of project-based learning mechanisms of BIM. Informal meeting, Knowledge team creation, and Standardisation are recommended for managers of BIM and other innovations. Innovation managers can balance ambidexterity by utilising an array of knowledge practices to encourage both exploitation and exploration. Proactive and tangible support such as the implementation of guidelines and protocols from the public sector in developing countries will promote BIM learning in organisations and encourage industry-wide adoption.
