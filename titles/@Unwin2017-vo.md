> This chapter examines skill formation organized by employers in the workplace. Its starting point is that all types of work involve knowledge and skill and, therefore, all workplaces are potential learning environments. The chapter discusses developments in workplace learning theory as well as the international empirical evidence on employer attitudes to and investment in in-work training. Illustrations from case study research are provided. It argues that workplace learning is contingent on the level of interaction of individuals with the way work is organized and managed, the nature of the employment contract including reward and incentive structures, the level of discretion employees have to determine how they work, and the extent to which employees are involved in decision making. The chapter concludes with recommendations for policy and practice.
