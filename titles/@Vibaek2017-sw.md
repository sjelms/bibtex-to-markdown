> [!abstract]
> The notion and the model of system structure seek to establish the idea of a systems view of buildings and architectural design that through the use of flexible constituent elements with varying degrees of integrated complexity, another central concept facilitates discussion about how architectural wholes are appropriately put together as assemblages of what the and future building industry is capable of producing. This is not about reinventing architecture and architectural creation but does represent a new way to look at what is already there -  an industrially produced architecture. The chapter argues that the new view can help facilitate a more active and strategic use of the present and the future building industry in order to create architecture, not just construction, specifically attached to time, place and cultural context, not just an expression of smooth processes or cost-efficient solutions.
