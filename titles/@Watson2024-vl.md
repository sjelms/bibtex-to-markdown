> Amelia Dicks, Director of Business Development at Wind River Built, tells us how her company is on a mission to bring back the starter home, and do it with style using modular home construction. She explains how modular home construction is the wave of the future, and how the modular construction method solves many of the building challenges our city and nation face in building more housing quickly. Amelia offers an interesting perspective with solutions to the development of more starter homes and the missing middle. She tells us how Wind River Built is poised to positively impact housing in the entire region, right here from Southeast Tennessee.
