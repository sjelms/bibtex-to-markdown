> This revised edition of The Visual Handbook of Building and Remodeling presents a substantially expanded and updated reference for residential design and construction, incorporating new chapters on energy-efficient green building practices and innovative storage solutions alongside the latest building code information. Designed for homeowners, builders, contractors, and architects, the volume employs a distinctive visual methodology, integrating more than 1,600 full-color drawings—over 400 of which are newly developed—to provide detailed, systematic coverage of materials, assemblies, built-in systems, and construction processes. Supplemented by more than 300 data tables, the handbook facilitates rapid access to technical information while supporting conceptual understanding through graphic representation. With over 250,000 copies of previous editions in circulation, this enhanced volume positions itself as a comprehensive and authoritative resource within contemporary residential construction practice.
