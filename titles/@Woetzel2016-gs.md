> Access to affordable housing is essential to individual well-being and economic stability, yet many cities face persistent shortages. This McKinsey Global Institute report examines California’s chronic housing crisis and outlines strategies to close the gap by adding 3.5 million homes by 2025. Using a quantitative model covering 34 housing markets and 16 income bands, the analysis finds that half of California’s households cannot afford local housing, with affordability virtually out of reach for low- and very-low-income households. The report proposes a fact-based blueprint for collaboration among government, the private sector, and citizens to expand housing supply and improve access.
