> Every day, millions of people travel to the virtual worlds of video games, diving into intense, escapist universes full of puzzles and adventure, grand battles and simulated societies. This chapter looks at video games as both a mirror of our society's desires and a model for new ways of conceptualising, designing and even realising architecture that may have no prerogative to be built in the traditional sense. Mainstream architecture is already adopting game engine software, which is particularly prevalent in the field of Virtual Reality visualisation. Games are interactive and involve decision-making on the part of the player, which is why it is important to go beyond the view of the omniscient administrator of SimCity and investigate the agency of citizens. Videogame Urbanism asks architecture students to consider a future where the disciplinary boundaries are so fluid that our distinction between projects realised physically or virtually disappears.
