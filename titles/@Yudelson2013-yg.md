> Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a user modeling method extensively used in the area of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). In the standard BKT implementation, there are only skill-specific parameters. However, a large body of research strongly suggests that student-specific variability in the data, when accounted for, could enhance model accuracy. In this work, we revisit the problem of introducing student-specific parameters into BKT on a larger scale. We show that student-specific parameters lead to a tangible improvement when predicting the data of unseen students, and that parameterizing students’ speed of learning is more beneficial than parameterizing _a priori_ knowledge.
